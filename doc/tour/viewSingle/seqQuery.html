<center><code>Sequence Query</code></center>

The sequence can be queried by sequence ID or remark, where the <tt>User</tt>
remarks are added through the <code>runSingleTCW</code> interface, and the <tt>TCW</tt> remarks are added by TCW during ORF
computation; one such remark ("Multi-frame") indicates that the sequence has aligned hits in
multiple frames.

<p>Sometimes it is easier if TCW assigns names to the sequences (option in <code>runSingleTCW</code>), in
which case, the original name (<tt>Orig ID</tt>) can still be viewed and queried on. Another <code>runSingleTCW</code> option
is to assemble the sequences, in which case the <tt>Orig ID</tt> will be replaced with the <tt>Longest</tt> read of the contig.

<p>One or more sequence can be selected followed by <tt>View Sequences</tt> and they will be shown in the main <tt>Sequence table</tt>. 

<p>This <tt>Query</tt> interface could be merged with the sequence <tt>Filter</tt> interface, but it has the
added ability of being able to modify the table; the following options are at the bottom of the table:

<table width='100%'><tr><td align='left' >
</td><td align='right' valign='top' class='smtxt'><a href=#top>Go to top</a> </td></tr></table>

Though the options for the annotation should be set in the runSingleTCW interface,
they can be <b>Save</b> and then the annotation run from the command line with:
<pre>
	./execAnno &lt;project&gt;
</pre>

<a id=update></a>
<h3>Updating or redoing annotation</h3>

You may wish to re-run annotation steps for following reasons:
<ol>
<li>Update to a newer AnnoDB (e.g. more recent UniProt release): In this case,
you would delete existing annotation and all existing hit (tab) files.
<li>Add a new AnnoDB: In this case, make sure to uncheck all annoDBs in the 
<ttp>runSingleTCW</ttp> interface that are already in the database.
<li>Remove an annoDB: In this case, you will need to delete the existing annotation
and reload all annoDBs that you want to keep. The original hit files can be reused.
<li>Add additional similar pairs. In this case, turn off all other options and run "<ttc>Annotate</ttc>;
additional pairs will be added with the existing hit files.
</ol>

<table style="width: 450px">
<tr><td class="top">The image on the right shows what can be removed. Select the top option for 
#1 and #3. Select the third item for the #1.
<td><a href="img/remove.png"><img src="img/remove.png" alt="" style="border: 1px solid black; width: 250px"></a>
</table>

Changes can be accomplished by editing the AnnoDB list in <ttp>runSingleTCW</ttp>, then
re-running <ttc>Annotate</ttc>, and responding to the yes/no prompts
which will appear on the console, as follows (note, at any point during these
question, you can Ctrl-C to stop the process):
<pre>
	?--Annotation exists in database. Enter [a/d/e]
	Add to existing annotation [a], Delete annotation [d], Exit [e]:
</pre>
Answer 'a' to add to the existing annotation.
<br>Answer 'd' to replace all annotation. Note that this
does NOT delete hit files from disk, and they may be loaded again if desired. 
<br>Answer 'e' to exit.

<p>The following is a flow for adding annotation from existing files.
<pre>
	Checking annoDB fasta
	   DB#1 diamond SP AA: projects/DBfasta/UniProt_demo/sp_plants/uniprot_sprot_plants.fasta
	   DB#2 blast SP AA: projects/DBfasta/UniProt_demo/sp_fullSubset/uniprot_sprot_fullSubset.fasta
	   DB#3. blastn GB NT: projects/DBfasta/NT/dcitri.fa
	   Pairs blastn: /projects/demoTra/hitResults/tra_seqNT.fa
	   Pairs tblastx: /projects/demoTra/hitResults/tra_seqNT.fa
	   Pairs diamond: /projects/demoTra/hitResults/tra_orfSeqAA.fa
	Checking for existing tab files

	?--At least one hit tab file exists for selected set.
	   Use current tab files [u], prompt on each tab file [p], exit[e]:  p

	   DB#1 uniprot_sprot_plants.fasta
		   Output exists: /projects/demoTra/hitResults/tra_SPpla.dmnd.tab; Date: Sun Jan 7 1:37:16 MST 2021
	?--Load this existing file [y] or perform new search [n]  [y/n]:
</pre>
A 'y' will use the existing file and not redo the search. 

<p>
If you get the prompt:
<pre>
	?--DB#1 The annoDB projects/DBfasta/UniProt_demo/sp_plants/uniprot_sprot_plants.fasta
		  has been processed previously. Continue? (y/n)? 
</pre>
This means you have already added an annoDB with the exact same path name. 

<h4>Pairs only</h4>
The pairs-only can be removed from the database using:
<pre>
	./execAnno &lt;DB Name&gt; -p
</pre>
<h4>Save database</h4>
To save an existing annotated database, use:
<pre>
	mysqldump -u &lt;user&gt; -p &lt;database_name&gt; &gt; &lt;dump_file_name&gt;
</pre>

<a name=top>

Though the options for the annotation should be set in the runSingleTCW interface,
they can be <b>Save</b> and then the annotation run from the command line with:
<pre>
./execAnno &lt;project&gt;
</pre>


<!--------------------------------------------->

<a name=update>
<table width='100%'><tr><td align='left' >
<h3>Updating or redoing annotation</h3>
</td><td align='right' valign='top' class='smtxt'><a href=#top>Go to top</a> </td></tr></table>

You may wish to re-run annotation steps for two reasons:
<ol>
<li>Update to a newer AnnoDB (e.g. more recent UniProt release): In this case,
you would delete existing annotation.
<li>Add a new AnnoDB: In this case, make sure to uncheck all annoDBs in the 
runSingleTCW interface that are already in the database.
<li>Remove an annoDB: In this case, you will need to delete the existing annotation
and reload all annoDBs that you want to keep. The original blast files can be reused.
</ol>
Both of these can be accomplished by editing the AnnoDB list in runSingleTCW, then
re-running "Annotate Sequences", and responding to the yes/no prompts
which will appear on the console, as follows (note, at any point during these
question, you can Ctrl-C to stop the process):
<p>
<div class="codesec"><pre>
?--Annotation exists in database. Enter [a/d/e]
Add to existing annotation [a], Delete annotation [d], Exit [e]:
</div></pre>
Answer 'a' to add to the existing annotation.
<br>Answer 'd' to replace all annotation. Note that this
does NOT delete blast result files from disk, and they may be loaded again if desired. 
<br>Answer 'e' to exit.

<p>
If you get the prompt:
<div class="codesec"><pre>
?--DB#1 The annoDB /projects/DBfasta/demo4/plants/demo_sprot_plants.fasta
      has been processed previously. Continue? (y/n)? 
</div></pre>
This means you have already added an annoDB with the exact same path name. If it is a new
version of UniProt, you probably want to have it delete all previous annotation 
(i.e. answer 'n', which will let you restart and answer 'y' to deleting annotation). 
If you answer
'y' to this prompt, it will add what is new from the annoDB 
(we do not recommend this -- its better to start fresh).
<p>If you get the prompt:
<div class="codesec"><pre>
DB#1 blast
   DBfasta file:  demo_sprot_plants.fasta
   Output file :  /projects/demo_exp/uniblasts/demo_exp_SPpla.tab
   Output File exists, dated: Wed Apr 20 15:03:14 MST 2011
?--Yes = use this existing file; No = perform new blast;  (y/n)? 
</div></pre>
A 'y' will use the existing file and not redo the blast. 
<p><font color=green>Note:</font> the file
name of the blast output uses the database type (SP, TR, GI) and the first three letters of the 
DBtaxo (e.g. SPpla is the SwissProt plant taxonomy database); if you have multiple databases
with the same output name, it will append numbered suffixes.  
<p>
We have annotated many databases with no problems, however, if you are updating an 
annotated database, it is worth making a dump of the database
before beginning just to be on the safe side. This can be done with
<pre>
mysqldump -u &lt;user&gt; -p &lt;database_name&gt; &gt;! &lt;dump_file_name&gt;
</pre>

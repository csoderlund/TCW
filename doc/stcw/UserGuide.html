	This document covers building a TCW database for a single species. Terminology:
<ul>
<li><i>Dataset</i> is one of the following: 
(1) A file of sequences with optional count data from conditions, where the sequences can be nucleotide or amino acid. 
(2) A set of sequences to assemble, with optional quality data. 
<li><i>Conditions</i> may be tissues, treatments, etc that are to be compared, with optional replicates. 
<li><i>AnnoDBs</i> are fasta files of sequences (nucleotide or amino acid) to compare the dataset sequences
against for annotation. TCW provides special support for UniProt, but can use any file of sequences (e.g. Genbank nr),
see <a href=AnnoDBs.html class="ext" target="_blank">runAS</a> for obtaining and formatting the files.
</ul>
Note: there is still some old terminology floating around, such as the term "library" use to be used for both "dataset" and "condition",
and the acronym PAVE is still found in some places as it was the original name for TCW.

		Note that you can set the number of CPUs to use, although the 
		demo does not need more than one. 
		
		<p>1. Click the <tt class=c>Build Database</tt> command		
			<br>This loads the datasets in this section; there is one 
			dataset of transcripts ("Ginger") with count data for three
			conditions ("Root","Tip","Zone"), where the first condition has five replicates
			and the second two conditions have one replicate. 	 
				
			<p>Note: A command button will turn gray while it is
				executing, and there will be output to the terminal with any errors, warning and the state of execution.
			<br>Note: A command button will not be active when it is not valid to run, e.g.
				the <tt class=c>Instantiate</tt> command is grayed out since the datasets have not been loaded.
				
		<p>2. Click the <tt class=c>Instantiate</tt> command.
				<ul><li>The <tt class=c>Skip Assembly</tt> was checked so the transcripts will simply be loaded, without
				assembly. 
				<li>The <tt class=c>Use Sequence Names From File</tt> is not checked, meaning that the TCW will assign new,
				sequentially-numbered names prefixed by the <tt>singleTCW ID</tt>. 
				</ul>
				<p>From this point on, you may run
				<pre class=tt>./viewSingleTCW tra</pre> or select the <tt class=c>Overview</tt> button
				after any step to view the results that have been entered.

at which point, it will run without any further prompts. For example, 
if the <tt>GO database</tt> has not been built yet (see Step 5), the following will be written to the terminal:		
<pre>
+++Warning: GO_tree go_demo is missing; ignoring GO step
--Please confirm above parameters. Continue with annotation?  (y/n)?
				</pre>
				Answer 'y' to continue.
<p>The output to the terminal and to the file <tt>projects/demoTra/logs/anno.log</tt> will look something like 
<a href=anno.log.html class="ext" target="_blank">this log</a> (this includes the GO annotation).
				
			<p>4. Click the <tt class=c>Add Remarks or Location</tt> button (bottom of window), a window will popup (not shown).

		<p>5. To build the GO database, see <a href="AnnoDBs.html#demo" class="ext" target="_blank">
		Demo annotation setup</a>. Then execute <tt class=c>GO Only</tt>.

<p><font color=green>Time for adding the GOs</font>: This take longer than the other TCW steps, where it can takes around 2 to 5 minutes for this demo.  
If it takes a lot longer than 4 minutes for this step, 
check your <tt>max_allows_packet</tt> (see <a href=../Trouble.html class="ext" target="_blank">Trouble shooting</a>).
					
			<p>6. To compute differential expression (DE), install R and the respective packages. From the command line, execute
<pre class=tt>
./runDE tra
</pre> 
				The <a href="DiffExp.html" class="ext" target="_blank">DE Guide</a> describes how to install the necessary

<h3>Defining a sequence dataset</h3>
<table width=100% cellpadding=5>
<tr><td>
A TCW project must have at least one sequence dataset, which is a FASTA file of sequences.
Select <tt class=c>Add</tt> beside the <tt>Sequence Datasets</tt> and the panel will be replaced with the one 
shown on the lower right. 

<p>
<tt class=c>SeqID</tt>: Enter the dataset name (a brief identifier) in the first box; it should be a short (3-5 characters) name.
<p>
<tt class=c>Sequence File:</tt> Click the browse button labeled "..." to select the 
				fasta file of sequences.			
			    The ">" lines in the fasta file are the sequence names, 
			    where characters other than letters, numbers, and underscores will be
			    changed to underscores. 

<p>
Additional information:
<ol>
<li><tt class=c>Count File:</tt> For already assembled transcripts (e.g. Illumina) or protein sequences, there maybe associated count files.
Adding them is covered below in <a href=#cnt>Defining count data</a>.
<li><tt class=c>Quality File:</tt> For Sanger ESTs or 454 data, there may be a quality file (standard Phred quality scores in fasta format).
<li><tt class=c>Sanger ESTs:</tt> TCW assumes the 5' ESTs have the ".f" suffix and the 3' ESTs have the ".r" suffix. If there
are different from this, enter the correct ones.
<li><tt class=c>ATTRIBUTES:</tt> Enter any additional information
as desired in this section. This information is <i>very important</i> as it provides a description of the data
that is stored in the database and shown on the <tt class=c>Overview</tt> panel of <code>viewSingleTCW</code>. 
</ol>

<p>After entering the files and attributes, select <tt class=c>Keep</tt>.
The main panel will reappear with the <tt>SeqID</tt> and <tt>Title</tt> added to
the <tt>Sequence Datasets</tt> table. Additionally, the information will be written in

<h5>Build combined count file</h5>
			
		<p>
	It is common to have separate count files for each sample, in which case,
you can use the <tt class=c>Build combined count file</tt> to generate the combined
count file. This explanation will continue using the "demoTra" example.

<p>The easiest way to handle many sample files is to put them in one directory. Name each
file with the "condition name + replicate number"; TCW parses up to the first "." to determine the condition
and replicate number (the suffix can be whatever you want).

For example, in the directory <tt class=c>projects/demoTra/counts</tt> are the files:
				<pre class=tt>
Root1.cnt	Root2.cnt	Root3.cnt	Root4.cnt	
Root5.cnt	Tip1.cnt	Zone1.cnt
				</pre>

<table width=100%>
<tr><td valign="top">	
As shown in this example, the file prefix (e.g. Root1) is shown in the  "Rep name" column in the table on the right, 
and is used as the column heading in the combined file. Furthermore, the
replicates for a condition will be grouped together by the text up to the number 
(as shown previously in <a href=#rep>Define biological replicates</a>).
<p>To build the file:
<ul>
<li>Select <tt class=c>Build combined count file</tt> from the <tt class=c>Add and edit a Sequence Dataset</tt> panel.
<li>Select <tt class=c>Add Directory of Files</tt>, which brings up a file chooser window; select the directory containing
the files (e.g. "count") and it loads all files from the selected directory, as shown on the right.
<li>Select <tt class=c>Generate File</tt> to build the file called "Combined_read_counts.csv". Control will return to 
the Sequence Dataset panel, and this filename will be automatically entered into the "Count File:" entry box.
</ul>
</td>

<td valign="top">
<a href="img/runSingleSample.png"><img width=450 src="img/runSingleSample.png"  border=1></a>
</td>
</tr>	
</table>
		
<p>If your files are not in one directory, or not named correctly, you will need to add them individually
using the <tt class=c>Add Rep File</tt>. You probably will need to edit the "Rep name" column; to edit the name,
highlight the row then click the mouse at the right edge of the entry box (if that doesn't work, trying clicking
at the beginning).
<p>
As <a href="#rep">already described</a>, the replicates are grouped by clicking the <tt class=c>Define Replicates</tt> button on
the main window.

		Three types of computation are performed:
		<ol>
    	<li>Basic annotation: GC content and ORFs
    	<li>Functional annotation: Compares one or more protein and/or nucleotide databases ("annoDBs") to each sequence in the database. If the annoDBs are
from UniProt, add the associated GO annotations.
    	<li>Similar sequences: Compute similar sequences, which is particularly useful for analyzing the results of

<h3>ORF finder options</h3>
GC content and ORF finding is always performed when <tt class=s>Annotate</tt> is performed.
The ORF finder uses the annoDB hits to aid in determining the best open reading frame. 
See the <a href=ORF.html class="ext" target="_blank">ORF</a> document on the ORF finding options and
details on how it works. If after annotation is complete, you just want to run the ORF finder, use
the  <tt class=s>ORF only</tt> option.

<h3>AnnoDBs and UniProt</h3>
The term "AnnoDB" refers to a fasta file of nucleotide or protein sequences, 
where the TCW sequences (transcript or protein) will be searched against the annoDBs for functional annotation.
Read <a href=AnnoDBs.html class="ext" target="_blank">Annotation Setup</a> for obtaining UniProt and other annotation databases.

make sure the last step was <tt>TCW.anno</tt>, which creates a file of UniProt databases. 
Select <tt>Import AnnoDBs</tt>, which pops up a
file chooser, then select the <tt>projects/TCW.anno.&lt;date&gt;</tt>; all your UniProts will be added at once

<p class=lrpad><tt class=c>Unannotated only</tt>: if you select this, it will only search against any unannotated
sequences. The annoDBs are searched in the order they are listed in the AnnoDB table, so selecting this
option does not make sense for the first annoDB. This option is somewhat obsolete now that there are
super-fast search programs.

<li><tt class=c>Use Existing Hit Tabular File</tt>:
<p class=lrpad>You can supply your own hit results file (must be in tabular format). 
You must still provide the name of the annoDB fasta file as
it extracts the description and species from it.

<h3>GO Database (GO, KEGG, EC, InterPro, Pfam annotations)</h3>	
    	<p>
See <a href=AnnoDBs.html class="ext" target="_blank">Annotation Setup</a> for creating the GO database.
Once the GO database is created, it can be selected, as shown on the right. Once selected, it will display
the available GO Slim categories in the drop-down below it; alternatively, a OBO formated file may be entered.

<h3>Similar Sequences</h3>
			The annotator can compare all sequences and determine the top N pairs, 
			where their alignments can be viewed in <code>viewSingleTCW</code>. 
			This can be helpful for assessing the stringency of an assembly by 
			viewing how similar sequences are.

<h3>Adding to annotation</h3>
Additional annotation can be added at a later time; see <a href=AnnoGuide.html#update class="ext" target="_blank">Update and Redo annotation</a> 
		in the Annotation Guide.

Select the <tt class=s>Add Remarks or Locations</tt> button at the
bottom of the <code>runSingleTCW</code> panel; the panel on the right will replace the main panel.
Details of each function is provided below.
<p>Both the locations and remarks can be search and viewed in <code>viewSingleTCW</code>. Remarks
are a very good way to add additional information to the sequences.
<td>
<a href="img/addRmkLoc.png"><img src="img/addRmkLoc.png" width=500 border=1>
</table>
		<h4>Add Location File</h4>
Select the "..." on the <tt class=s>Location File</tt> row, select a location file, and press <tt class=s>Add</tt> on the same row.
		
<p>The file is a set of rows where the first word of each row is the sequence ID and the rest of the row is the format:
<pre class=tt>
		group:start-end(strand), e.g. SC_1:392-496(-)
</pre> 
<ul>
<li>The group would be the supercontig, scaffold, chromosome, linkage, etc. 
If TCW can extract numbers/X/Y from the end of the group (e.g. chr1, chrX), 
it adds a column containing just the "Group" number that can be sorted numerically in <code>viewSingleTCW</code>.
<li>The sequence ID must match a sequence ID in the database,
		so you probably will want to "Instantiate" the sequences using "Use Sequence Names from File".
</ul>
		<p>A script is available, <tt>scripts/extractCodingLoc.pl</tt>, to generate the transcript sequence file from a
		 genome sequence and GFF3 file. It also generates the location file in the format needed by TCW. It only works with 
		a subset of the GFF3 files, so probably needs to be modified 
		for your GFF3 or GTF file. It uses BioPerl.
		<p>The group name, start, end and strand are columns in the TCW database that can be viewed in <code>viewSingleTCW</code>
		by selecting the "Columns" tab on the left, then checking the columns under "General".
		

<h4>Remark File</h4>
Select the "..." on the <tt class=s>Remark File</tt> row, select the file of remarks, and press <tt class=s>Add</tt> on the same row.
		<p>The file is a set of rows where the first word of each row is the sequence ID and the rest of the row is the Remark.
		<p>	
<ul>
<li>Single and double quotes will be changed to spaces.
<li>Semi-colon will be changed to a colon.
<li>Do not use the following remarks, as they are added during annotation:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Multi-frame; ORF contains Hit; Hit contains ORF; ORF overlaps Hit; !LG
</ul>
<p>
In <code>viewSingleTCW</code>, the 'User Remark' can be viewed by selecting the "Columns" tab on the left, then checking the "Remark"
column under "General". The remark can also be search on in the "Basic Queries Sequence"; this is a great way to add
additional information about your sequences. 
<font color=green><i>If you make the remarks "keyword=value", you can then search on the keyword
		to get a specific group of sequences.</i></font>	
<h4>Remove Remarks</h4>
Selecting this button will remove all user remarks. Note, TCW adds remarks in the 'TCW Remark' column; these
are not removed.

<h3>Trouble shooting</h3>
If errors occur, a message is written to the terminal
and the Java stack-trace is written to the file <tt>sTCW.error.log</tt>. This can 
be sent to us so we can help you trouble shoot the problem, that is, if the 
message to the terminal is not sufficient to indicate how to fix the problem. NOTE:
errors are appended to this file, so if an error keeps re-occurring without getting
fixed, the file can get quite large.
	
<p>If the information on the <code>runSingleTCW</code> panel does not look right, remove
<tt>/projects/&lt;project&gt;/LIB.cfg</tt> to start over. You can try fixing the problem
by editing this file, but its necessary to format it correctly.
If that does not work, email <tt>tcw@agcol.arizona.edu</tt> and we will guide you on how to enter the information.

<p>If you have many sequences (e.g. transcripts) in the database and/or many annoDBs,
this can take a lot of memory. Running <tt>Annotate</tt> sets the memory to 4096, which may not be 
enough; in this case, once <code>runSingleTCW</code> is ready to annotate your database, exit and run from the command line:
<pre class=tt>
	./execAnno &lt;project&gt;
</pre>
You can increase the memory size in the <code>execAnno</code> script.

<h2>Differential Expression</h2>

		TCW integrates several different R packages for computing differential expression of transcripts, including
		<code>EdgeR</code> and <code>DESeq2</code>; an R script containing the R commands to compute DE can also be supplied. GOseq is supported for 
		computing DE enrichment of GO categories. The DE computations are pairwise, i.e. conditions are compared two
		at a time. Each comparison results in a 
		column added to the database, which may be viewed and queried. The DE modules are accessed either
		through <code>./runDE</code> on the command line, or the 'Launch DE' button at the bottom of the 
		Manager interface (<a href="#Fig1">Fig. 1</a>). 
		<p>
		For full details on the DE modules, see the <a href="DiffExp.html" class="ext" target="_blank">Differential Expression Guide</a>.

		Users do not ordinarily need to look at the underlying directories and files used by TCW, however they are described
		here since it may be helpful at times. 
		<p>
		When a project is added with <tt class=c>Add Project</tt>, <code>runSingleTCW</code> 
		creates a directory under <tt>/projects</tt> with the user supplied name 
		(referred to here as <tt>&lt;project&gt;</tt>). 
		The <tt>projects/&lt;project&gt;</tt> directory has a 
		<tt>LIB.cfg</tt> file where <code>runSingleTCW</code> saves all the library information and 
	   a <tt>sTCW.cfg</tt> file where <code>runSingleTCW</code> saves all the assembly and annotation information. 
		
		<p>Though you can put your data files anywhere that <code>runSingleTCW</code> can access, 
		you may want to put your data 
		files in the <tt>projects/&lt;project&gt;</tt> directory in order to keep everything in one place. 
		Also, the <tt>/DBfasta</tt> directory contains a subset of the UniProt files for the demo; this is 
		a good location to put all annoDB files.
		
		<p>Both <code>execAssm</code> and <code>execAnno</code> write to the <tt>projects/&lt;project&gt;</tt> directory, where 
			<code>execAssm</code> writes mainly log files, while <code>execAnno</code> puts all 
		hit results in <tt>hitResults</tt> subdirectory. Hit files are NOT removed as they may be reused. 
		Both programs write log files to a <tt>log</tt> subdirectory.

		As mentioned above, <code>runSingleTCW</code> creates <tt>LIB.cfg</tt> and <tt>sTCW.cfg</tt> files under
		the <tt>/projects/&lt;project&gt</tt> directory. Once created, you can run the three steps from the 
		command line instead of through the interface.

		<br>The LIB.cfg and sTCW.cfg files can be edited with a text editor, but be careful as

		Once a project is created, it is viewed and queried using <code>viewSingleTCW</code>.
		This program is launched either:
<ol><li>From the command line (<tt>./viewSingleTCW</tt>), which
brings up a panel of mySQL databases with the <tt>sTCW_</tt> prefix, where databases can be selected to view.
<li>From the command line using the <tt>singleTCW ID</tt> or <tt>database name</tt> as a parameter (e.g. <tt>viewSingleTCW tra</tt>).
<li>Through the button at the bottom of the Manager interface (<a href="#Fig1">Fig. 1</a>).

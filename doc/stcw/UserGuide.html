This document covers building a TCW database for a single species. Terminology:
<ul>
<li><i>Dataset</i> is one of the following: 
(1) A file of sequences with optional count data from conditions, where the sequences can be nucleotide or amino acid. 
(2) A set of sequences to assemble, with optional quality data. 
<li><i>Conditions</i> may be tissues, treatments, etc that are to be compared, with optional replicates. 
<li><i>AnnoDBs</i> are fasta files of sequences (nucleotide or amino acid) to compare the dataset sequences
against for annotation. TCW provides special support for UniProt, but can use any file of sequences (e.g. Genbank nr),
see <a href=AnnoDBs.html class="ext" target="_blank">runAS</a> for obtaining and formatting the files.
<li>NT-sTCWdb is a database built with nucleotide sequences. AA-sTCWdb is a database built with amino acid
sequences.

Before starting the demo, follow steps for <a href="../Install.html" class="ext" target="_blank">Installation</a>. 
Make sure your <ttx>HOSTS.cfg</ttx> is correct.
<p>The following three demos are supplied with the package.

		<p>At the command line, type 
		<pre>	./runSingleTCW</pre>
	
		The window shown on the right will be launched. 

<a id="step1demo"></a>
		Select <ttx>demoTra</ttx> from the <ttc>Project</ttc> drop-down list. 
		
		<p>1. Click the <ttc>Step 1. Build Database</ttc> button.
			<br>This loads the datasets in this section; there is one 
			dataset of transcripts  with count data for three
			conditions ("Stem","Root","OLeaf"), with five replicates each.
				
			<p>Note: 
			<ul><li>A command button will turn gray while it is
				executing, and there will be output to the terminal with any errors, warning and the state of execution.
			<li>A command button will not be active when it is not valid to run, e.g.
				the <ttc>Instantiate</ttc> command is grayed out since the datasets have not been loaded.
			</ul>	
		<p>2. Click the <ttc>Step 2. Instantiate</ttc> button.
				<ul><li>The <ttc>Skip Assembly</ttc> was checked so the transcripts will simply be loaded, without
				assembly. 
				<li>The <ttl>Use Sequence Names From File</ttl> is not checked, meaning that the TCW will assign new,
				sequentially-numbered names prefixed by the <ttx>singleTCW ID</ttx>. 
				</ul>
				<p>From this point on, you may <ttc>Launch viewSingleTCW</ttc> or select the <ttc>Overview</ttc> button to check status.

<a id="step3demo"></a>		
<p>3. Click the <ttc>Step 3. Annotate</ttc> button.
<br>This searches against several UniProt partial databases which have been provided as part of the package.		
<p>There may be one or more yes/no prompts for you to answer at the
terminal; <mark class="green">keep an eye on the terminal until it says "Start annotating sequences"</mark>,
at which point, it will run without any further prompts. For example, 
if the <ttx>GO database</ttx> has not been built yet (see Step 5), the following will be written to the terminal:
<pre>
	+++Warning: GO_tree go_demo is missing; ignoring GO step
	--Please confirm above parameters. Continue with annotation?  (y/n)?
</pre>
Answer 'y' to continue.
<p>The output to the terminal and to the file <ttx>projects/demoTra/logs/anno.log</ttx> will look something like 
<a href=anno.log.html class="ext" target="_blank">this log</a> (this includes the GO annotation).
				
<p>4. Click the <ttc>Add Remarks or Location</ttc> button (bottom of window), a window will popup (not shown).
	<ol><li>Select the "..." on the same line as the label <ttc>Location file:</ttc>, select the file "traLocations.txt",
	then select the button <ttc>Add</ttc> on the same line.
	<li>Select the "..." on the same line as the label <ttc>Remark file:</ttc>, select the file "traRemarks.txt",
	then select the button <ttc>Add</ttc> on the same line.
	</ol>
				
<p>5. To build the GO database, see <a href="AnnoDBs.html#demo" class="ext" target="_blank">
	Demo annotation setup</a>. Then execute <ttc>GO Only</ttc>.

<p><mark class="green">Time for adding the GOs</mark>: 
This take longer than the other TCW steps, where it can takes around 2 to 5 minutes for this demo.  
If it takes a lot longer than 4 minutes for this step, 
check your <ttx>max_allows_packet</ttx> (see <a href="../Trouble.html" class="ext" target="_blank">Trouble shooting</a>).
					
<p>6. To compute differential expression (DE), install R and the respective packages. From the command line, execute
<pre>
	./runDE tra
</pre> 
The <a href="DiffExp.html" class="ext" target="_blank">DE Guide</a> describes how to install the necessary
packages, and how to add DE p-values to the TCW database. If Step 5 has been run, then you can also add
the p-values for the GO.

<p>See <a href="tra.html" class="ext" target="_blank">overview</a> for the final demoTra overview from the above 6 steps.

You will be prompted for a project name; enter a name using letters, numbers, or underscores (no spaces). 	
When you select "OK", the following occurs:
<ol>
<li>The "name" will be entered for <ttc>singleTCW ID</ttc> and "sTCW_&lt;name&gt;"  will be entered for the <ttc>Database</ttc>.

</ol>
<p>Instead of using the <ttc>Add Projects</ttc>, you may create a directory under <ttx>/projects</ttx> and put your sequence files along
with any other optional files (i.e. quality and count); when you select the project pulldown, you
will see your project (the project pulldown lists all directories under <ttx>/projects</ttx>).

<h2>Build Database</h2>	
<td style="text-align: right"><a href="#top">Go to top</a></td></tr></table>

<a id=input></a>
<h3>Input files</h3>
There are three possible scenarios:

<h4>1. Sequence and count files</h4>
The typical input is a file of transcripts and associated read counts. The transcript file is a fasta file,
where the sequence name must be under 30 characters, using only letters, numbers, and underscores.
<p>
The sequence names in the count file must match the sequence names in the sequence file. The count file
is a tab or space delimited file. The first line of
the count file is the heading "SeqName" followed by the replicate names. The replicate names should end in
the replicate number, e.g. 
<pre>
	SeqName	Leaf1	Leaf2	Leaf3	Root1	Root2	Root3
</pre>
This defines two conditions with three replicates each. The remaining rows must have the exact same number of
columns. More information is provided in <a href="#cnt">Defining count data</a>.
<p><i>The conditions will be displayed in <ttp>viewSingleTCW</ttp> in the same order as the input.</i>

<h4>2. Sequence and quality files</h4>
TCW supports assembly of Sanger ESTs, 454 reads, or a mix of these datasets with transcripts. See
<a href="./AssemGuide.html#names" class="ext" target="_blank">Assembly names</a> for more information on this data.

<h4>3. Multiple sequence files</h4>
You may enter multiple sequence and condition files, which may or may not be assembled. You must make sure
that all "Condition" and "SeqID" are unique, i.e. a SeqID and Condition cannot have the same name.
 
<a id=seq></a>
<h3>Entering a sequence dataset</h3>

<p>
<table class="tablex">
<tr><td>

A TCW project must have at least one sequence dataset, which is a FASTA file of sequences.
Select <ttc>Add</ttc> beside the <ttc>Sequence Datasets</ttc> and the panel will be replaced with the one 
shown on the lower right. 
<td class="top">

<tr><td>
<ttc>SeqID</ttc>: Enter the dataset name (a brief identifier) in the first box; it should be a short (3-5 characters) name.
<p>
<ttc>Sequence File:</ttc> Click the browse button labeled "..." to select the fasta file of sequences.
<p>
Additional information:
<ol>
<li><ttc>Count File:</ttc> For already assembled transcripts (e.g. Illumina) or protein sequences, there may be associated count files.
Adding them is covered below in <a href="#cnt">Defining count data</a>.
<li><ttc>Quality File:</ttc> For Sanger ESTs or 454 data, there may be a quality file (standard Phred quality scores in fasta format).
<li><ttc>Sanger ESTs:</ttc> TCW assumes the 5' ESTs have the ".f" suffix and the 3' ESTs have the ".r" suffix. If there
are different from this, enter the correct ones.
<li><ttc>ATTRIBUTES:</ttc> Enter any additional information
as desired in this section. This information is <i>very important</i> as it provides a description of the data
that is stored in the database and shown on the <ttc>Overview</ttc> panel of <ttp>viewSingleTCW</ttp>. 
</ol>

<p>After entering the files and attributes, select <ttc>Keep</ttc>.
The main panel will reappear with the <ttx>SeqID</ttx> and <ttx>Title</ttx> added to
the <ttx>Sequence Datasets</ttx> table. Additionally, the information will be written in 
<ttx>projects/&lt;name&gt;/LIB.cfg</ttx>.

The count values can have decimal points, but the numbers will be rounded.

<h5>Build from multiple count files</h5>
It is common to have separate count files for each sample, in which case,
you can use the <ttc>Build from multiple count files</ttc> to generate the combined
count file. This explanation will continue using the "demoTra" example.

<p>The easiest way to handle many sample files is to put them in one directory. Name each
file with the "condition name + replicate number"; TCW parses up to the first "." to determine the condition
and replicate number (the suffix can be whatever you want).

For example, in the directory <ttc>projects/demoTra/counts</ttc> are the files:
<pre  style="font-size: 12px">
	Root1.cnt	Root2.cnt	Root3.cnt	Root4.cnt	
	Root5.cnt	Tip1.cnt	Zone1.cnt
</pre>
This is a different set of conditions then shown in the "Example count file", where there are 5 replicates for root but no 
replicates for tip or zone.
<p>
<table class="tablex">
<tr><td class="top">	
As shown in the right, the file prefix (e.g. Root1) is shown in the  "Rep name" column in the table on the right, 
and is used as the column heading in the combined file. Furthermore, the
replicates for a condition will be grouped together by the text up to the number 
(as shown previously in <a href="#rep">Define biological replicates</a>).
<p>To build the file:
<ul>
<li>Select <ttc>Build from multiple count file</ttc>.
<li>Select <ttc>Add Directory of Files</ttc>, which brings up a file chooser window; select the directory containing
the files (e.g. "count") and it loads all files from the selected directory, as shown on the right.
<li>Select <ttc>Generate File</ttc> to build the file called <ttx>Combined_read_counts.csv</ttx>. Control will return to 
the Sequence Dataset panel, and this filename will be automatically entered into the "Count File:" entry box.
</ul>

<a href="img/runSingleSample.png"><img src="img/runSingleSample.png" alt="" style="border: 1px solid black; width: 450px"></a>
</td>
</tr>	
</table>
		
<p>If your files are not in one directory, or not named correctly, you will need to add them individually
using the <ttc>Add Rep File</ttc>. You probably will need to edit the "Rep name" column; to edit the name,
highlight the row then click the mouse at the right edge of the entry box (if that doesn't work, trying clicking
at the beginning).
<p>
As <a href="#rep">already described</a>, the replicates are grouped by clicking the <ttc>Define Replicates</ttc> button on
the main window.

<table style="width: 100%"><tr><td style="text-align: left">
<h2>Instantiation (with optional assembly)</h2>	
<td style="text-align: right"><a href="#top">Go to top</a></td></tr></table>

<p><ttc>Skip Assembly</ttc>:
If the input is already assembled transcript sequences, or protein sequences, or gene sequences, 
check this option.
If the datasets are ESTs, or multiple transcript datasets that you want to assemble together,
do not select this option and see <a href="./AssemGuide.html"  class="ext" target="_blank">Assembly Guide</a>.

<p>Press <ttc>Instantiate</ttc> to either assemble or finalize the sequences in the database.
				
<p><ttc>Use Sequence Names from File</ttc>: If the sequences are NOT going to be assembled, then this checkbox is relevant, as follows:
If you want TCW to name the sequences, do not check this option; 
TCW will rename the sequences using the <ttc>SingleTCW ID</ttc> followed by sequential numbers.
If you want to use the original names from file, check this option; note the following restrictions: 
		<ul><li>Characters other than letters, numbers, or underscores
		will be replaced by underscores. 
<li>The names must be under 25 characters. Note that the names supplied by
		sequencers are often longer than allowed, which will make this fail.
</ul>
For instantiation without assembly, this step does the following: (1) the transcripts are loaded, (2) the replicates
are loaded, and the sum of the replicates for each condition are used to compute the TPM (transcripts per million).

Three types of computation are performed:
<ol>
    <li>Basic annotation: GC content and ORFs
    <li>Functional annotation: Compares one or more protein and/or nucleotide databases ("annoDBs") to each sequence in the database. If the annoDBs are
from UniProt, add the associated GO annotations.
    <li>Similar pairs: Compute pairs of similar sequences within the input set.

<h3>AnnoDBs and UniProt</h3>
The term "AnnoDB" refers to a fasta file of nucleotide or protein sequences, 
where the TCW sequences (transcript or protein) will be searched against the annoDBs for functional annotation.
Read <a href=AnnoDBs.html class="ext" target="_blank">Annotation Setup</a> for obtaining UniProt and other annotation databases. 

<table class="tablex">
<tr><td class="top">
<ttc>Import AnnoDBs</ttc> provides a way to enter all UniProt databases at once. 
If you have used <a href=AnnoDBs.html class="ext" target="_blank"><ttp>runAS</ttp></a>
for the annotation setup,
make sure the last step was to select the <ttc>AnnoDBs.cfg</ttc> button, which creates a file of UniProt databases. 
Select <ttc>Import AnnoDBs</ttc>, which pops up a
file chooser, then select the <ttx>projects/AnnoDBs_UniProt_&lt;date&gt;</ttx> (or <ttx>sTCW.cfg</ttx> of another project); 
all your UniProts will be added at once.

<h3>Options</h3>
<p>The <ttc>Options</ttc> button below the AnnoDBs table provides additional options for:
 <ul>
 <li>ANNOTATION  
  <li>ORF FINDER
 <li>SIMILAR PAIRS
 </ul>
 The second option and part of the third are not available for TCW database created from protein sequences. 

<table class="tablex">
<tr><td class="top">
<a id="go"></a>
<h4>GO Database (GO, KEGG, EC, InterPro, Pfam annotations)</h4>	

See <a href=AnnoDBs.html class="ext" target="_blank">Annotation Setup</a> for creating the GO database.
Once the GO database is created, it can be selected, as shown on the right. Once selected, it will display
the available GO Slim categories in the drop-down below it; alternatively, a OBO formatted file may be entered.  
  		
<a id="orf"></a>
<h4>ORF finder options</h4>
GC content and ORF finding is always performed when <ttc>Annotate</ttc> is performed.
The ORF finder uses the annoDB hits to aid in determining the best open reading frame. 
See the <a href=ORF.html class="ext" target="_blank">ORF</a> document on the ORF finding options and
details on how it works. If after annotation is complete, you just want to run the ORF finder, use
the  <ttc>ORF only</ttc> option.
  		
<a id="sim"></a>		
<h4>Similar Pairs</h4>
The annotator can compare all sequences and determine the top N pairs, 
where their alignments can be viewed in <ttp>viewSingleTCW</ttp>. Only the <ttp>blastp</ttp>
option works for AA-STCWdbs.  

<p>More information on all the above is provided on the <ttc>Annotation Options</ttc> panel Help page
and <a href="AnnoGuide.html#update" class="ext" target="_blank">Update and Redo annotation</a>.

<table>
<tr><td class=top>
Select the <ttc>Add Remarks or Locations</ttc> button at the
bottom of the <ttp>runSingleTCW</ttp> panel; the panel on the right will replace the main panel.
Details of each function is provided below.
<p>Both the locations and remarks can be search and viewed in <ttp>viewSingleTCW</ttp>. Remarks
are a very good way to add additional information to the sequences.
<td>
<a href="img/addRmkLoc.png"><img src="img/addRmkLoc.png" alt="" style="border: 1px solid black; width: 450px"></a>
</table>
		
<h4>Add Location File</h4>
Select the "..." on the <ttl>Location File</ttl> row, select a location file, and press <ttc>Add</ttc> on the same row.
		
<p>The file is a set of rows where the first word of each row is the sequence ID and the rest of the row is the format:
<pre>
		group:start-end(strand), e.g. SC_1:392-496(-)
</pre> 
The "group" would be the supercontig, scaffold, chromosome, linkage, etc. 
If TCW can extract numbers/X/Y from the end of the group (e.g. chr1, chrX), 
it adds a column containing just the "Group" number that can be sorted numerically in <ttp>viewSingleTCW</ttp>.
The sequence ID must match a sequence ID in the database,
		so you probably will want to "Instantiate" the sequences using "Use Sequence Names from File".
<p>
A script is available, <ttx>scripts/extractCodingLoc.pl</ttx>, to generate the transcript sequence file from a
genome sequence and GFF3 file. It also generates the location file in the format needed by TCW. It only works with 
a subset of the GFF3 files, so probably needs to be modified for your GFF3 or GTF file. It uses BioPerl.
	
<p>The group name, start, end and strand are columns in the TCW database that can be viewed in <ttp>viewSingleTCW</ttp>
by selecting the "Columns" tab on the left, then checking the columns under "General".
		

<h4>Add Remark File</h4>
Select the "..." on the <ttl>Remark File</ttl> row, select the file of remarks, and press <ttc>Add</ttc> on the same row.
<p>The file is a set of rows where the first word of each row is the sequence ID and the rest of the row is the Remark.
<ul>
<li>Single and double quotes will be changed to spaces.
<li>Semi-colon will be changed to a colon.
</ul>
<p>
In <ttp>viewSingleTCW</ttp>, the <ttl>User Remark</ttl> can be viewed by selecting the <ttc>Columns</ttc> tab, 
then checking the <ttl>User Remark</ttl> column under <ttl>General</ttl>. 
The remark can also be search on in the <ttl>Basic Queries Sequence</ttl>; this is a great way to add
additional information about your sequences. 
<mark class=green><i>If you make the remarks "keyword=value", you can then search on the keyword
		to get a specific group of sequences.</i></mark>	

<h4>Remove Remarks</h4>
Selecting this button will remove all user remarks. There are also "TCW Remarks" that are added during ORF finding; these
are not removed.

<h3>Remove...</h3>

<h3>Trouble shooting</h3>
If errors occur, a message is written to the terminal
and the Java stack-trace is written to the file <ttx>sTCW.error.log</ttx>. This can 
be sent to us so we can help you trouble shoot the problem, that is, if the 
message to the terminal is not sufficient to indicate how to fix the problem. NOTE:
errors are appended to this file, so if an error keeps re-occurring without getting
fixed, the file can get quite large.
	
<p>If the information on the <ttp>runSingleTCW</ttp> panel does not look right, remove
<ttx>/projects/&lt;project&gt;/LIB.cfg</ttx> to start over. You can try fixing the problem
by editing this file, but it is important to format it correctly.
If that does not work, email <ttx>tcw@agcol.arizona.edu</ttx> and we will guide you on how to enter the information.

<p>If you have many sequences (e.g. transcripts) in the database and/or many annoDBs,
this can take a lot of memory. Running <ttc>Annotate</ttc> sets the memory to 4096, which may not be 
enough; in this case, once <ttp>runSingleTCW</ttp> is ready to annotate your database, exit and run from the command line:
<pre>
	./execAnno &lt;project&gt;
</pre>
You can increase the memory size in the <ttp>execAnno</ttp> script.

<h2>Differential Expression</h2>
<td style="text-align: right"><a href="#top">Go to top</a></td></tr></table>		
		
TCW integrates several different R packages for computing differential expression of transcripts, including
<ttp>EdgeR</ttp> and <ttp>DESeq2</ttp>; an R script containing the R commands to compute DE can also be supplied. GOseq is supported for 
computing DE enrichment of GO categories. The DE computations are pairwise, i.e. conditions are compared two
at a time. Each comparison results in a 
column added to the database, which may be viewed and queried. The DE modules are accessed either
through <ttp>./runDE</ttp> on the command line. 
<p>

<h2>Directory structure and configuration files</h2>
<td style="text-align: right"><a href="#top">Go to top</a></td></tr></table>
		
Users do not ordinarily need to look at the underlying directories and files used by TCW, however they are described
here since it may be helpful at times. 
<p>
When a project is added with <ttc>Add Project</ttc>, <ttp>runSingleTCW</ttp> 
creates a directory under <ttx>/projects</ttx> with the user supplied name 
(referred to here as <ttx>&lt;project&gt;</ttx>). 
The <ttx>projects/&lt;project&gt;</ttx> directory has a 
<ttx>LIB.cfg</ttx> file where <ttp>runSingleTCW</ttp> saves all the library information and 
a <ttx>sTCW.cfg</ttx> file where <ttp>runSingleTCW</ttp> saves all the assembly and annotation information. 

<p>Though you can put your data files anywhere that <ttp>runSingleTCW</ttp> can access, 
you may want to put your data 
files in the <ttx>projects/&lt;project&gt;</ttx> directory in order to keep everything in one place. 
Also, the <ttx>/DBfasta</ttx> directory contains a subset of the UniProt files for the demo; this is 
a good location to put all annoDB files.

<p>The three major steps write to the <ttx>projects/&lt;project&gt;</ttx> directory. The <ttc>Annotate</ttc>
step puts all hit results in <ttx>hitResults</ttx> subdirectory. Hit files are NOT removed as they may be reused. 


<a id=batch></a>
<table style="width: 100%"><tr><td style="text-align: left">		
<h2>Batch Processing</h2>
<td style="text-align: right"><a href="#top">Go to top</a></td></tr></table>

As mentioned above, <ttp>runSingleTCW</ttp> creates <ttx>LIB.cfg</ttx> and <ttx>sTCW.cfg</ttx> files under
the <ttx>/projects/&lt;project&gt;</ttx> directory. Once created, you can run the three steps from the 
command line instead of through the interface.
<table class="tabley">
<tr><td><i>Action</i><td><i>Executable</i><td><i>Configuration</i>
<tr><td>Build Database<td><ttp>execLoadLib</ttp><td>LIB.cfg
<tr><td>Instantiate<td><ttp>execAssm</ttp><td>sTCW.cfg
<tr><td>Annotate<td><ttp>execAnno</ttp><td>sTCW.cfg
</table>
		
<br>The LIB.cfg and sTCW.cfg files can be edited with a text editor, but be careful as
<ttp>runSingleTCW</ttp> and the executables expects the syntax to be exactly as it writes the file.

<p>Each command line script takes as input the &lt;project&gt; name, along with some optional flags; execute
the script followed by -h to see the flags (e.g. <ttx>./execAnno -h</ttx>). All three take as input
the "-n", which suppresses any prompts and uses defaults (as described by -h); this is good for batch processing.
<p>The instantiation (or assembly) computed TPM (transcripts per kilobase per million); in order to compute the
RPKM instead, execute:
<pre>
	./execAssm &lt;project&gt; -r
</pre>

<td style="text-align: right"><a href="#top">Go to top</a></td></tr></table>

Once a project is created, it is viewed and queried using <ttp>viewSingleTCW</ttp>.
This program is launched either:
<ol><li>From the command line (<ttx>./viewSingleTCW</ttx>), which
brings up a panel of mySQL databases with the <ttx>sTCW_</ttx> prefix, where databases can be selected to view.
<li>From the command line using the <ttl>singleTCW ID</ttl> or <ttl>sTCW Database</ttl> 
as a parameter (e.g. <ttx>viewSingleTCW tra</ttx>).
<li>Through the button at the bottom of the Manager interface (<a href="#Fig1">Fig. 1</a>).

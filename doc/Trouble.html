<h2>MySQL suggested settings</h2>

<a name="mysql">
<h3>Slow to load sequence and annotation</h3>

Two MySQL settings are especially important for SyMAP performance (and generally for InnoDB table
performance). 
<p>
<table cellspacing=3 cellpadding=2 border=1 rules=all>
	<tr>
		<td align=left valign=top><tt>innodb_buffer_pool_size</td>
		<td>
The default is too low for most purposes. You should set this to around 1Gb if possible (note that 
the units are bytes). 
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td align=left valign=top><tt>innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit</td>
		<td>
The default setting is 1, which results in very slow uploading of data.
		</td>
	</tr>
</table>
<p>
To check the values, start mysql and type:
<pre>
show variables like "innodb_buffer_pool_size"; 
show variables like "innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit"; 
</pre>
To change the variables, then type:
<pre>
set global innodb_buffer_pool_size=1073741824;
set global innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit=0;
</pre>
Alternatively, You can set these in the MySQL configuration file <tt>my.cnf</tt> and restart MySQL. 
Note that <tt>my.cnf</tt> is typically located at <tt>/etc/my.cnf</tt>, on both Linux and Mac.

<p>Different machines and MySQL installations can produce different results with these variables.
If the SyMAP demo-seq to demo-seq2 load and synteny computations seem slow, 
try different combinations of these two variables to see what performs the fastest inserts.

<a name="slow">
<h3>Slow queries</h3>
<table cellspacing=3 cellpadding=2 border=1 rules=all>
	<tr>
		<td align=left valign=top><tt>max_allowed_packet</td>
		<td>
This should be at least 500M if possible (the units are bytes). 
		</td>
	</tr>	
</table>
<p>
To check the value, start mysql and type:
<pre>show variables like "max_allowed_packet"; </pre>
To change this variable, then type:
<pre>set global max_allowed_packet=1073741824;</pre>


<h3>runAS</h3>
The following is necessary for <code>runAS</code> to create the TCW-GO database.
<table cellspacing=3 cellpadding=2 border=1 rules=all>
	<tr>
		<td align=left valign=top><tt>local_infile</td>
		<td>
Set to 1. 
		</td>
	</tr>	
</table>
<p>To change the variable in MySQL:

<pre>
set global local_infile=1
</pre>

<h2>MySQL connection errors</h2>

If TCW cannot connect to the database, generally the problem is the access privileges of the DB_user
 in the HOSTS.cfg (firewalls are another common problem, as discussed in the next section). 
MySQL privileges are very specific and must exactly match the hostname in HOSTS.cfg. 
<br> For example, if DB_host = localhost, DB_user=user, then privileges must be granted to 'user@localhost'.
Sometimes you may need equivalent variants, e.g. if localhost has IP 74.125.239.17 
and domain my.domain.org, you may also need 'user@74.125.239.17' and 'user@my.domain.org'. 
<p>
Privilege problems are easiest to debug by running the 'mysql' command line client.<br>
Run
<div class="codesec"><pre>
mysql -u &lt;DB_user&gt; -p -h &lt;DB_host&gt;
</div></pre> 
and enter the DB_password when prompted. If this fails, then the user/password privileges have
to be corrected. If it succeeds, then try to add and drop a test database:
<div class="codesec"><pre>
>create database TCW_PRIVTEST;
>drop database TCW_PRIVTEST;
</pre></div>
If this fails you can still run TCW, but you will need an administrator to create
the TCW database since <tt>runSingleTCW</tt> cannot do it.

<h2>Out of memory</h2>
<p>Java applications must specify their memory usage in advance, so it is very 
important to set it high enough. The setting is adjusted by editing the appropriate launch script,
by increasing the "-Xmx" parameter value on the java command line.   
<p>
If you run out of memory while annotating, edit the <tt>execAnno</tt> script, and load
your annotation using <tt>./execAnno &lt;project&gt;</tt>.
<p>
If you run out during assembly, edit the <tt>execAssm.pl</tt> script, and run the
assembly using <tt>perl execAssm &lt;project&gt;</tt>.     
<p>
If you run out during initial project loading, edit the <tt>execLoadLib.pl</tt> script, and load
 using <tt>perl execLoadLib.pl &lt;project&gt;</tt>.     
<p>
Other phases such as viewing or DE computation are unlikely to run out of memory, but their memory 
can also be increased through the appropriate launch scripts <tt>runDE</tt> and <tt>viewSingleTCW</tt>.
<p>
If a user of the web applet runs out of memory, they will need to close their browser and increase
applet memory through the Java Preferences manager. On Macs this is found under
<tt>Applications/Utilities/Java Preferences</tt>
<br>
and on Windows it is on the Control Panel. On Linux, find the executable called "ControlPanel" 
by following links from the browser plugin directory (typically <tt>~/.mozilla/firefox/plugins</tt>
to find the java installation directory, and look in its <tt>bin</tt> directory. 
<p>
Once you have the Control Panel open, look for a panel where you can enter the runtime parameters
for java applets, and add "-Xmx1024m", for 1Gb (which should be plenty).

<h2>Ext executable problems</h2>
<h3>Not executable</h3>
If on startup, you get a message like:
<pre>
***Error: file is not executable: ext/mac/mafft/mafft.bat
</pre>

From the <tt>/Ext</tt> directory, <tt>chmod -R 775 mafft</tt> to give all necessary
executables and scripts in the directory permission to execute.

<p>NOTE: MacOS 10.15 (Catalina) does not allow downloaded programs to execute. Running through TCW,
you will either get popup that states "xxx cannot be opened because developer cannot be verified", or
the program will just fail. See <a href=./Mac-OSX.html#ext class="ext" target="_blank">MacOS</a>.


<h3>External program fails</h3>
Generally, the command is written to the terminal by TCW. Copy and paste it at the command line. By executing it like
this, you will see all the external programs messages.
<p>If this does not work, try executing it in the <tt>/Ext</tt> directory.
<p>See <a href=./Install.html#replace  class="ext" target="_blank">Install Replace Executable</a>.

<h2>SingleTCW errors</h2>
<code>runSingleTCW</code> and <code>viewSingleTCW</code>:
If errors occur in either of these two programs, a message is written to the terminal
and the Java stack-trace is written to the file <tt>sTCW.error.log</tt>. This can 
be sent to us so we can help you trouble shoot the problem, that is, if the 
message to the terminal is not sufficient to indicate how to fix the problem. NOTE:
errors are appended to this file, so if an error keeps re-occurring without getting
fixed, the file can get quite large.

<p><code>runSingleTCW</code>:
If the information on this window does not look right, remove
<tt>/libraries/&lt;project&gt;/LIB.cfg</tt> to start over. You can try fixing the problem
by editing this file, but its necessary to format it correctly.
<p>If you have many sequences (e.g. transcripts) in the database and/or many annoDBs (databases to blast against),
this can take a lot of memory. Running <tt>Exec Annotate Sequences</tt> from <tt>runSingleTCW</tt>
sets the memory to 4096, which may not be 
enough; in this case, once <tt>runSingleTCW</tt> is ready to annotate your database, exit and run from the command line:
<pre>
	./execAnno &lt;project&gt;
</pre>
You can increase the memory size in the <tt>execAnno</tt> script.

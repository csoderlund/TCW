Reference: C. Soderlund (2019) Transcriptome computational workbench (TCW): 
	analysis of single and comparative transcriptomes. Submitted.

Description: Single-transcriptome and multi-transcriptome analysis. For single-transcriptome,
similarity search against annotation databases, GO annotation, ORF finding and differential
analysis. For multi-transcriptome, compute similar pairs, provide statistics for pairs,
compute clusters, provide statistics for clusters. Both programs (singleTCW and multiTCW) provide
extensive query and display of the results.

Requirements: Java and MySQL to build the database and view the results.  R for differential analysis. 
The BLAST executable is necessary. The KaKs_Calculator is optional for multi-transcriptome analysis.
All other external software used by TCW is contained in the package tar file. 

To use TCW, download the TCW package from the link at the top. The tar file
contains all necessary jar files, scripts and demo files. Follow the instructions
at http://www.agcol.arizona.edu/software/tcw/doc/. 

The TCW code on this site does not include the external packages; you will need to
extract them from the TCW package or provide them yourself. The necessary Java classes
are provided, see TCW/java/README.

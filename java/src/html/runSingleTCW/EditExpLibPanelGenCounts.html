<h3>Build combined counts file</h3>

Often the counts for each replicate are provided in separate files,
which need to be combined into one table for import into TCW. This interface is designed
to make that easier. 
<p>
To use this interface, your count files need to have a two-column format without headers:
<pre>
Sequence_name1	count1
Sequence_name2	count2
...
</pre>

<p>
<table border=0 cellspacing=4 cellpadding=3>
<tr><td valign="top" nowrap>Add Directory of Files<td>Go to the directory with your count files and
select "Open". All files will be checked for the correct format, and the correct ones will be 
entered into the table. The Rep name is extracted from the file name; it can be changed by 
editing the "Rep Name" column.
<tr><td valign="top" nowrap>Add Rep File<td>A file chooser window will pop up to chose a file. The "Rep name"
will be determined from the file name; it can be changed by editing the "Rep Name" column.  

<tr><td valign="top" nowrap>Remove Rep<td>Select a row to remove it from the table.
<tr><td valign="top" nowrap>Clear<td> Clears the table contents.

<tr><td valign="top" nowrap>Generate File<td>The file "Combined_read_counts.csv" will be generated,
which will have one column for each of your original files, with the specified Rep names as headers.
This will be entered as the Count File in the  Add/Edit panel, and when you press "Keep"
on that panel, the information will be transferred to the main window.


<tr><td valign="top" nowrap>Close<td> The window will be closed without discarding the table contents.
However, if you exit runSingleTCW, the information will be lost. 
</table>
<p>To edit the "Rep Name" column, you may have to click at the very beginning or end of the cell you 
want to change; the cell will turn white indicating you can edit.

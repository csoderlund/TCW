<h2>Add remarks or locations to database</h2>	

<table class=tabley>
<tr><td nowrap><b>Location File</b><td> Reads the file, removes any existing location information,
and adds the location information to each sequence. 
<tr><td nowrap><b>Remarks File</b><td> Reads the file and adds the remarks to any existing <tt>User remark</tt>
for the sequence.

<tr><td nowrap><b>Remove Remark:</b><td> removes the remarks from the sequence <tt>User remark</tt> column.
</table>
<br>For the first two, select the file with the "<b>...</b>", which brings up the <b>File Chooser</b>.
It expects the files to end in ".txt" or ".tsv". If your file does not have either suffix,
select "All Files" from the <b>File Format:</b> drop-down. After selecting the file, click the
<b>Add</b> on the same line.

<p>There is also a <tt>TCW Remark</tt>, which contains information from the ORF finder; this <tt>TCW Remark</tt> is not touch
by the above commands.

<h2>Locations</h2>
The file is a set of rows where the first word of each row is
the 'sequence ID' and the rest of the row is the location in the format: 
<pre>
    supercontig_name:start-end(strand)
    e.g. SC_1:392-496(-).
</pre>
Recall: the 'sequence ID's will be generated by TCW unless you had selected 'Use Sequence Names from File'.
<p>
In <tt>viewSingleTCW</tt>, the location information can be viewed in
the sequence table by selecting the columns under the "General" columns tab,
and a Filter can be set to view only those sequences with a location.

<h2>User Remarks</h2>
The file is just a set of rows where the
first word of each row is the 'sequence ID', and the rest of the row is added 
as the remark for the sequence. 
<ul>
<li>Single and double quotes will be changed to spaces.
<li>The semi-colon ';' will be changed to a colon ':'.
<li>The dollar sign '$' will be changed to the ampersand '&amp;'; 
</ul>

<p>
In <tt>viewSingleTCW</tt>, the <tt>User Remark</tt> is a column that you can view in the table 
by selecting it under the <tt>General</tt> columns tab, and a Filter can be set to view only those sequences with a remark.
<p>
You can search on the <tt>User Remark</tt> in the <tt>Basic Sequence Query</tt>. This is a great way to add additional information about your sequences.
<i>If you make the remarks "keyword=value" pairs, you can then search on the keyword
to get a specific group of sequences.</i>

<h2>Define replicates</h2>

You may edit the third column to define the replicates. Just put your cursor in the cell you want to edit,
hit the backspace keep and the cell will turn white indicating you can edit it.
<p>
The table is pre-filled out using the column names found in your
count files. The three columns are as follows:
<p>
<b>SeqID:</b> The name of the sequence dataset that the count file
is associated with. 
<p>
<b>Column name from file:</b> This column lists the replicate identifiers (column headers)
 which were found in the Count File. Each replicate will
 have a <i>unique</i> name, for example "MyLib1, MyLib2, MyLib3". 
 <p> 
 <b>Condition:</b> This is the column which you edit to define condition (e.g. tissue, treatment)
 for each replicate set. If your "Conditions" are of the form name+number, as
 in the MyLib1, MyLib2, MyLib3 example, then the root name (e.g. MyLib) will be automatically
entered and you will not need to edit the name. Otherwise you will need to make
 up suitable condition names and edit the corresponding rows. <i>Make sure that these
 names don't match any others that were already used for a different Sequence Database.</i>

<p>When the table is correct, press "Keep".
<p>
<i>Note:</i> If you are creating multiple singleTCW databases to compare with multiTCW, it
is extremely important that you use the exact same condition names for equivalent conditions,
e.g. if you have a maize and rice database where they both have 'leaf' and 'root', give them
the same name so they will correspond in multiTCW.

<h2>Define Replicates</h2>

<p>
The table will be populated with the <b>Associated Counts</b> table on the main panel.
The three columns are as follows:
<table class=tablex>
<tr><td>SeqID <td>The name of the sequence dataset that the count file
is associated with. 
<tr><td>
Column name from file <td>This column lists the replicate identifiers (column headers)
 which were found in the Count File. Each replicate will
 have a <i>unique</i> name, for example "MyLib1, MyLib2, MyLib3". 
 <tr><td valign=top>
 Condition <td>This is the column to define condition (e.g. tissue, treatment)
 for each replicate set. If your replicate identifier (Column name from file) are of the form name+number, as
 in the root1, root2, root3 example, then the condition (e.g. root) will be automatically
entered and you will not need to edit the name. Otherwise you will need to make
 up suitable condition names and edit the corresponding rows. <i>Make sure that these
 condition name is unique and is not the same as any SeqIDs.</i>
 To edit the 3rd column, put your cursor in the cell you want to edit,
hit the backspace keep and the cell will turn white indicating you can edit it.
</table>
<p>When the table is correct, press <b>Keep</b>, which will update the <b>Associated Counts</b>
table on the main panel.
<p>
<i>Note:</i> If you are creating multiple singleTCW databases to compare with multiTCW, it
is extremely important that you use the exact same condition names for equivalent conditions,
e.g. if you have a maize and rice database where they both have 'leaf' and 'root', give them
the same name so they will correspond in multiTCW.

	<h2>Assembly Options</h2>
	The default assembly parameters have been tuned on a large variety of datasets. See online documentation
	for more detailed information on the assembly process. Note that TCW can assemble Sanger and 454 raw reads, 
	as well as existing transcript sets, but cannot assemble raw Illumina reads or similar datasets.

				Determines which overlaps are accepted from the clique MegaBLAST output.<br>
				Minimal overlap: minimum matching bases allowed.<br>

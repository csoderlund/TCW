<h2>Add or Edit Sequence Datasets</h2>
Only the <b>SeqID</b> and <b>Sequence File</b> are required, so enter these first. 
<br>The default location for all files are under the <tt>/projects/&lt;project&gt;</tt> directory,
but they can be elsewhere. 

<p>
	<table class=tablex>
		<tr>
			<td valign="top" width=100><b>SeqID</b></td>
			<td>A short identifier for the dataset. Use letters, numbers, and underscores only. 
			<i>It must be unique, i.e. it cannot be the same as another SeqID or any condition name.</i></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td valign="top"><b>Sequence File</b></td>
			<td>The FASTA sequence file for this dataset, where each ">" must have a unique 
			identifier for the sequence. If the file is not in the <tt>/project</tt> project directory, 
			provide its full path.
			<br><br><b>File Chooser</b>: 
			The FASTA file may have any of the following suffixes: .fa, .fasta, .fna, .ffn, .faa, .frn.
			It is valid to have the compress ".gz" added to any of these suffixes. If your file has
			a different suffix, use the <b>File Format:</b> "All Files".
			</td>
		</tr>
		
		<tr>
			<td valign="top"><b>Count File</b></td>
			<td>A file that contains all the read or spectral counts, as follows:
			The first row contains the column headings "SeqName" followed by the replicate names; the 
			rest of the rows contain the sequence name followed by the counts (see the on-line 
			<tt>runSingleTCW</tt> UserGuide for more detail).
			<br><br><b>File Chooser</b>: The file should have the suffix ".txt".  If your file has
			a different suffix, use the <b>File Format:</b> "All Files".
			<br><br>The file is read for the column names when <b>Keep</b> is selected, 
			and the <b>Associated Counts</b> table on the main panel has a row added for each condition.
			
		</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td valign="top"><b>Build from multiple count files</b></td>
			<td>It is often the case that replicate counts are in separate files, where each
			file has two columns: sequence name and read count, where the sequence names are
			the same as found in the sequence file. This function allows you to enter your
			count files and build a single file of counts.
		</tr>
		<tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
		<tr>
			<td valign="top"><b>Quality File</b></td>
			<td>Optional FASTA quality file for the sequence file.
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
		
		<tr>
				<td colspan=2>
					<b>Sanger ESTs</b>: Mate-pairs should have the same name but with a 5' and 3' suffix.
					The default suffixes are .f and .r. If your file uses other suffixes (e.g. .5 and .3),
					then enter them in the respective text boxes.
				</td>
			</tr>
		
			<tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
		<tr>
				<td colspan=2>
					<b>ATTRIBUTES:</b> These values are listed on the <tt>viewSingleTCW</tt> 
					<b>Overview</b> panel. Do not use single or double quotes. Attributes may be edited after the
					database is created by using the <b>Edit</b> button on the main panel.

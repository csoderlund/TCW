<h2>Add or Edit Sequence Datasets</h2>
Only the SeqID and Sequence File are required, so enter these first. 
<br>The default location for all files are under the /projects/&lt;project&gt; directory,
but they can be elsewhere. 

<p>
	<table border=0 width=800>
		<tr>
			<td valign="top" width=150>SeqID</td>
			<td>A short identifier for the dataset. Use letters, numbers, and underscores only. 
			<i>It must be unique, i.e. it cannot be the same as another SeqID or any condition name.</i></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td valign="top">Sequence File</td>
			<td>The fasta sequence file for this dataset, where each ">" must have a unique 
			identifier for the sequence. If the file is not in the "/project" project directory, 
			provide its full path.</td>
		</tr>
		
		<tr>
			<td valign="top">Count File</td>
			<td>A file that contains all the read or spectral counts, as follows:
			The first row contains the column headings "SeqName" followed by the replicate names; the 
			rest of the rows contain the sequence name followed by the counts (see the UserGuide 
			for more detail).
			<br>The file is read for the column names when "Keep" is selected, and the Count Table 
			on the main window has a row added for each condition.
		</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td valign="top">Build from multiple count files</td>
			<td>It is often the case that that replicate counts are in separate files, where each
			file has two columns: sequence name and read count, where the sequence name is
			the same as found in the sequence file. This function allows you to enter your
			count files and build a single file of counts.
		</tr>
		<tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
		<tr>
			<td valign="top">Quality File</td>
			<td>Optional fasta quality file for the sequence file.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
		
		<tr>
				<td colspan=2 align=left>
					<b>Sanger ESTs</b>: mate-pairs should have the same name but with a 5' and 3' suffix.
					The default suffixes are .f and .r. If your file uses other suffixes (e.g. .5 and .3),
					then enter them in the respective text boxes.

				<td colspan=2 align=left>
					<b>ATTRIBUTES:</b> These values are listed on the viewSingleTCW 
					overview page. Do not use single or double quotes. Attributes may be edited after the
					database is created by using the "Edit" button on the main window.

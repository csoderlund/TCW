<h2>Add or Edit Sequence Datasets</h2>
Only the SeqID and Sequence File are required, so enter these first. 
<br>The default location for all files are under the /libraries/&lt;project&gt; directory,
but they can be elsewhere. 
<br><i>All SeqID and Condition names must be unique. Replicate names must be unique.</i>
<p>
	<table border=0 width=800>
		<tr>
			<td valign="top" width=150>SeqID</td>
			<td>A short identifier for the dataset. Use letters, numbers, and underscores only. 
			It must be unique. Also, the replicate names must be unique.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td valign="top">Sequence File</td>
			<td>The fasta sequence file for this dataset, where each ">" must have a unique 
			identifier for the sequence. If the file is not in the "/libraries" project directory, 
			provide its full path.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td valign="top">Quality File</td>
			<td>Optional fasta quality file for the sequence file.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
		
		<tr>
			<td valign="top">Count File</td>
			<td>A file that contains all the read or spectral counts, as follows:
			The first row contains the column headings "Sequence" followed by the replicate names; the 
			rest of the rows contain the sequence name followed by the counts (see the UserGuide 
			for more detail).
			<br>The file is read for the column names when "Keep" is selected, and the Count Table 
			on the main window has a row added for each condition.
		</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td valign="top">Build Combined Count File</td>
			<td>It is often the case that that replicate counts are in separate files, where each
			file has two columns: sequence name and read count, where the sequence name is
			the same as found in the sequence file. This function allows you to enter your
			count files and build a single file of counts, which is read by the
			Load Data function.

<h2>Search Settings</h2>
mTCW requires the AA hit file, which is the result of a file of sequences in the databases
being searched against itself. The NT hit file is optional. The respective hit files
are used to create pairs in the database, and the pairs are used 
to compute the BBH and Closure clusters. For orthoMCL, the pairs are read from the AA blast file.
 
<ul>
<li>If the hit file (<tt>hitsAA.tab</tt>) does not exist:
the main panel will say "&lt;Search-program&gt; AA file", where &lt;Search-program&gt; may be
<tt>Blast</tt>, <tt>Diamond</tt> or <tt>Usearch</tt>. 
Before executing "Run Search", you can
set the search program (see www.agcol.arizona.edu/tcw/doc/Search.html), and you can change the 
default parameters. 
<p>
<li><i>Important</i>. If the hit file <b>DOES</b> exist, then the main panel will say
"Use existing file" and will not let you re-create the hit file. 
To generate a different hit file, you need to remove
the existing one, which can be done from the main panel with the "Remove..." button. Alternatively,
you can rename the existing hit file.
</ul>

<p>These same instruction apply to the NT blast file, but you cannot select the
search program as only Blastn can be used for the NT self-blast. 
This option is NOT available if any of your input sTCWdbs are created from protein sequences.


<h3>Running the search yourself</h3>
If you want to run the search on a different machine (e.g. computed on an HPC cluster):
<ol>
<li>When the database is built, it creates a sub-directory <tt>projcmp/&lt;project name&gt;/hitResults</tt> which 
contains the file of proteins sequences (<tt>combineAA.fasta</tt>).
<li>Use the fasta file as input to blast and have it produce the tabular output.
<li>Put the blast tabular formated file in the <tt>hitResults</tt> directory with the
name <tt>hitsAA.tab</tt>.
</ol>
The same instructions apply generating the nucleotide blast file, where the input would
be <tt>combineNT.fasta</tt> to produce the file <tt>hitsNT.tab</tt>; this only applies
if none of the input sTCWdbs are created from protein sequences.

<h2>Pair Stats Settings</h2>

<p>Dependencies:
<ul>
<li><b>Add Pairs from Hit</b> must be executed before <b>PCC of TPM</b>.
<br>&nbsp;

<li><b>Add New Clusters</b> must be executed before the alignments.
<br>&nbsp;

<li><b>Run Stats</b> with <b>Write</b> selected must be executed 
before <b>Read</b> can be selected. See KaKs below.
</ul>

<h3>PCC (Pearson Correlation Coefficient) </h3>
PCC is computed on the TPM for shared conditions. This can be run at anytime after
the pairs have been added.

<h3>Alignment of hit pairs in cluster</h3>
If you execute <b>Run Stats</b> with <b>Compute statistics</b> and <b>KaKs files - Write</b> selected, 
the following will occur:
<ol>
<li>Perform alignments using dynamic programming on all pairs that (i) have a hit and (ii) are in
 a cluster together.
<li>Compute statistics for each pair and store the results in the database for query by <tt>viewMultiTCW</tt>.
<li>Compute summary statistics for the <tt>viewMultiTCW</tt> overview page.
<li>Write the alignments to file for input to <tt>KaKs_calculator</tt>
</ol>
Dynamic programming is a more precise alignment but takes longer than blast, moreover, it has
not be parallelized. To align over 200k pairs took over 2 hours on a linux machine (if you have
a big dataset, plan to leave it running over night).

<h4>KaKs</h4>
<ol>
<li>The <b>write</b> will write alignment files into <tt>projcmp/&lt;project name&gt;/KaKs</tt> directory.
A file called <tt>runKaKs</tt> will also be written into this file. If your computer has N CPUs,
it will split the alignments into N files, which <tt>runKaKs</tt> will run concurrently. 
<br>&nbsp;

<li><tt>runKaKs</tt>: This script runs <tt>KaKs_Calculator</tt>, which is in the <tt>Ext</tt> directory.
If desired, change the method used by editing <tt>runKaKs</tt>. Then:
<pre>
cd projcmp/&lt;project name&gt;/KaKs
sh runKaKs
</pre>
<li>From <tt>runMultiTCW</tt>: Select <b>Read</b> in <b>Setting</b> and run <b>Run Stats</b> again.
</ol>
See KaKs below for more information.

<h3>Multiple alignment of cluster</h3>
This will execute the program <tt>MAFFT</tt> on each cluster, score each MSA, and enter the
resulting MSAs and scores into the database. Occassionally, <tt>MAFFT</tt> fails, in which case, <tt>MUSCLE</tt> is run.

<p>The MSA scores are the Sum-of-Pairs and Wentropy, where Wentropy is computed just like the 
<tt>MstatX</tt> program except the score is (1 - score). 

<p>The user can request
that external program <tt>MstatX</tt> be run instead, where any of their valid methods can be specified
(see <tt>runMultiTCW -h</tt>). If this step has already been run, but you 
want to try a <tt>MstatX</tt> method, select the <b>Compute MSA and score</b> option and <b>Run Stat</b>;
the MSAs in the database will be scored and the scores in the database will be updated.
<hr>

<h3>Add additional cluster sets</h3>
If you add additional cluster sets after executing <b>Run Stats</b> on initial clusters,
you can <b>Run Stats</b> again and it will only compute the pair and cluster statistics for the
new data. 

<p><b>KaKs</b>:
If you have already written the KaKs files, run the <tt>KaKs_calculator</tt>, and read in the results;
then, if you add more clusters and run this again, it will overwrite the original files. Since
they take a while to create, you may want to save the completed files, e.g.
<pre>
cd projcmp/&lt;project-name&gt;/Kaks
cat oTCW* >save_oTCW_files
</pre>
Do not prefix the saved file with 'oTCW' or 'iTCW' as TCW writes and reads files with those prefixes.

<p>The KaKs files are written to use the 'YN' method, which executes very fast. 
If you use a slower method, you may want to only  run the <tt>KaKs_calculator</tt> 
on only the BBH clusters, in which case, add them first, run the statistics 
with <b>KaKs Write</b> so only the BBH clusters are written
to file, then add other cluster sets if desired.

<h3>Change cluster sets</h3>
<ul>
<li>If you remove a cluster set after adding statistics,
<i>the pair statistics will still exist</i>.
<li>You can remove all pairs and clusters to start over by using the <b>Remove...</b> option
at the top and select "Pairs and clusters from database".
</ul>

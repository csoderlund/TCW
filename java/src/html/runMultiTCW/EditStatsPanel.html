<h2>Pair Stats Settings</h2>

<p>Dependencies:
<ul>
<li><b>Add Pairs from Hit</b> must be executed before <b>PCC of TPM</b>.
<br>&nbsp;

<li><b>Add New Clusters</b> must be executed before the alignments.
<br>&nbsp;

<li><b>Run Stats</b> with <b>Write</b> selected must be executed 
before <b>Read</b> can be selected. See KaKs below.
</ul>

<h3>PCC (Pearson Correlation Coefficient) </h3>
PCC is computed on the TPM for shared conditions. This can be run at anytime after
the pairs have been added. If there are many pairs and conditions, this can take awhile.

<h3>Alignment of hit pairs in cluster</h3>
If you execute <b>Run Stats</b> with <b>Compute statistics</b> and <b>KaKs files - Write</b> selected, 
the following will occur:
<ol>
<li>Perform alignments using dynamic programming on all pairs that (i) have a hit and (ii) are in
 a cluster together.
<li>Compute statistics for each pair and store the results in the database for query by <tt>viewMultiTCW</tt>.
<li>Compute summary statistics for the <tt>viewMultiTCW</tt> overview page.
<li>Write the alignments to file for input to <tt>KaKs_calculator</tt>
</ol>
Dynamic programming is a more precise alignment but takes longer than blast, moreover, it has
not be parallelized. To align over 200k pairs took over 2 hours on a linux machine (if you have
a big dataset, plan to leave it running over night).

<h3>KaKs</h3>
<ol>
<li>The <b>write</b> will write alignment files into <tt>projcmp/&lt;project name&gt;/KaKs</tt> directory.
A file called <tt>runKaKs</tt> will also be written into this file. If your computer has N CPUs,
it will split the alignments into N files, which <tt>runKaKs</tt> will run concurrently. 
<br>&nbsp;

<li><tt>runKaKs</tt>: This script runs <tt>KaKs_Calculator</tt>, which is in the <tt>Ext</tt> directory.
If desired, change the method used by editing <tt>runKaKs</tt>. Then:
<pre>
cd projcmp/&lt;project name&gt;/KaKs
sh runKaKs
</pre>
<li>From <tt>runMultiTCW</tt>: Select <b>Read</b> in <b>Setting</b> and run <b>Run Stats</b> again.
</ol>
See KaKs below for more information.

<h3>Multiple Alignment of cluster</h3>
This will execute the program <tt>MAFFT</tt> on each cluster, score the results, and enter the
scores into the database. One of the two scores computed is from executing the program 
<tt>MstatX</tt> and reading the results.

<p>The <tt>MAFFT</tt> and <tt>MstatX</tt> executables are in the sub-directory <tt>Ext/linux</tt>
for Linux and <tt>Ext/mac</tt> for Mac.

<h3>Add additional cluster sets</h3>
If you add additional cluster sets after executing <b>Run Stats</b> on initial clusters,
you can <b>Run Stats</b> again and it will only compute the pair and cluster statistics for the
new data. 

<p><b>KaKs</b>:
If you have already written the KaKs files, run the <tt>KaKs_calculator</tt>, and read in the results;
then, if you add more clusters and run this again, it will overwrite the original files. Since
they take a while to create, you may want to save the completed files, e.g.
<pre>
cd projcmp/&lt;project-name&gt;/Kaks
cat oTCW* >save_oTCW_files
</pre>
Do not prefix the saved file with 'oTCW' or 'iTCW' as TCW writes and reads files with those prefixes.

<p>The KaKs files are written to use the 'YN' method, which executes very fast. 
If you use a slower method, you may want to only  run the <tt>KaKs_calculator</tt> 
on only the BBH clusters, in which case, add them first, run the statistics 
with <b>KaKs Write</b> so only the BBH clusters are written
to file, then add other cluster sets if desired.

<h3>Change cluster sets</h3>
<ul>
<li>If you remove a cluster set after adding statistics,
<i>the pair statistics will still exist</i>.
<li>You can remove all pairs and clusters to start over by using the <b>Remove...</b> option
at the top and select "Pairs and clusters from database".
</ul>

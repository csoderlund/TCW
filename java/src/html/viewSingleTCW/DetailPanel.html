<h1>Sequence Details</h1>
<b>Best ORF:</b> Shows the RF (reading frame) and coordinates; a "'" indicates a missing start or stop. 
The TCW remark is at the end (See Basic Sequence Help for the TCW Remark Legend).
<p><b>DB hits:</b> 
<ul>
<li>The columns <u>E-value</u>, <u>%Sim</u>, <u>Align</u>, <u>Start</u> and <u>End</u> are from the best 
search results for the hit (i.e. from <tt>BLAST</tt> or <tt>DIAMOND</tt>). 
<li>The column <u>Align</u> is in the hit coordinates (e.g. amino acids if the hit is a protein), 
whereas the <u>Start</u> and <u>End</u> are in the sequence coordinates.
<li>The options <b>GO...</b>, <b>Align...</b> and <b>Show/Copy/Export...</b> all have options that use
the DB hits table contents or selection.
</ul>


<h3>Detail Options - second row of buttons</h3>
<ol>
<li><b>Counts</b> toggle: Toggles between counts, TPM (or RPKM), and Replicates (if there are replicates).

<li><b>DB hits</b> toggle: Changes the set of hits listed in the DB hits table.
<ul>
<li><u>Best Hits (BS, AN, GO)</u>. See Introduction for more information on the following.
<ul>
<li>BS is best bit-score. 
<li>AN is best annotation.
<li>WG is best with GO.
<li>The Best BS, AN, and WG may all be the same, or any two of them the same. 
</ul>
<li><u>Best per annoDB</u>: In preprocessing, the sequences in the database are generally searched against
one or more annotation databases, which are referred to as an <i>annoDBs</i>. 
For example, the sequences
may have been searched against SwissProt Plants and TrEMBL Plants taxonomic databases. The best
hit for each is listed.
<li><u>Distinct regions</u>: A set of hits that represent the regions of the sequence for which
hits align to based on hit coordinates. Note the Start and End coordinates in the table, they will
not be the same, though may overlap some.
<li><u>Unique annotation</u>: Determines the unique descriptions, after filtering on: 
(1) ignore putative, hypothetical and predicted, (2) remove last character of description as often a number or letter.
<li><u>Unique species</u>: Lists one of each species that was hit
<li><u>Total</u>: All hits to the sequence. 
</ul>
<i>Note: sometimes its necessary to click in the window to get it to change the table, after changing the
DB Hits option.</i>

<li><b>Show...</b>
This only has one option, which is <u>Selected Hit Info</u>. This shows all information associated with the
hit to sequence.

<li><b>Copy...</b>
This is a menu of options to copy content to the clipboard (to "Paste" elsewhere). The first five refer
to the sequence. The last three require a hit to be selected in the DB hits table. 

<li><b>Export...</b> Writes a file of the sequence or DB hits.
</ol>

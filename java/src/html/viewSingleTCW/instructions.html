<h2>Instructions</h2>
Terminology:
<ul>
<li><i>Sequence:</i> The input may be TCW-assembled transcripts, transcript sequences, proteins or genes.
<li><i>Conditions:</i>A condition may be a tissue type, treatment, etc.  
<li><i>AnnoDB:</i> A database in FASTA format against which the sTCW sequences were searched against
for annotation. The search used  <tt>Blast</tt> or <tt>Diamond</tt>.
<li><i>DB hit:</i> An alignment of an entry from an annoDB (e.g. UniProt) to an sequence. A given
sequence can <i>hit</i> an annoDB multiple times (have alignments to multiple entries) and
it can hit multiple different annoDBs (have alignments in more than one annoDB). 
<li><i>Best Eval:</i> The hit with the best search e-value.
<li><i>Best Anno:</i> From a list sorted on e-value, the first one with informative
annotation, which is any description that does not contain 
phrases such as "uncharacterized protein" (see 'Select Columns' Help for a more complete
description).
</ul>

Detailed Help is provided on each page; the following provides an overview
of what is available.

<h3>General</h3>
<b>&gt;&gt;Instructions</b> - this page
<p><b>&gt;&gt;Overview</b> - Summary of everything in database.
<p><b>&gt;&gt;Decimal Numbers</b> - Specify how to display decimal numbers.
<p><b>&gt;&gt;Find hits</b> - Search a sequence against the sequences in the database or a user
selected protein database. This requires the <tt>Blast</tt> and optional <tt>Diamond</tt> paths to 
be in the HOSTS.cfg file. 

<h3>Sequences</h3>

<b>&gt;&gt;Show All</b> - A table of all sequences in the database. 
<ul>
<li>To view a sequence from the table, select the sequence and then "View Selected Sequence".
<li>Change the columns in the table using "Columns" under "Sequence.
</ul>

<b>&gt;&gt;Columns</b> - Menu of columns for the sequence table.
<ul>
<li>Select or deselect columns.
<li>The columns are not immediately changed for existing tables. Either select "Refresh All Existing Tables"
or redisplay the table (listed on the left panel) and select "Refresh columns".
</ul>

<b>&gt;&gt;Filters</b> - A menu with specific filters for sequences.
<ul>
<li>Select one or more filters, then select "View Filtered Sequences". The sequences that pass all filters will
be displayed in a table. 
<li>If you are not seeing the columns you desire, go to the "Columns", change
the columns, come back to the table (it will be listed on the left), and click "Refresh Columns".
</ul>

<b>&gt;&gt;Results</b> - List all Filter query results.
<ul>
<li>All queries that have been performed will be listed in a table. 
<li>Selecting a label will redisplay it on the right, or select it from this Results table.
<li>To remove a label, select the 'x' beside it on the left panel, or remove it from the Results
table.
</ul>

<h3>Basic Queries</h3>
<b>&gt;&gt;Sequences</b> - Search on Seq ID, TCW Remarks or User Remarks.  
<ul>
<li> 
This builds a table from the results of the selected filters.
<li>The resulting sequences can be shown as "View Selected Sequence". 
<li>Columns can be changed with "Select Columns". 

</ul>

<b>&gt;&gt;AnnoDB Hits</b> - Search on the Hit Id (e.g. UniProt ID) or description. 
<ul>
<li>It works like the basic Sequences.
</ul>

<b>&gt;&gt;GO Terms</b> - Search on the GO term or description. 
<ul>
<li>It works like the basic Sequences.
</ul>


<hr>
<h3>Similar Sequence Pairs</h3>
This section will only exist if the database was built with the "Similar Pairs" option.
All options are the same as above, except apply to sequence pairs.

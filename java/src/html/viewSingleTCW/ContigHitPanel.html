<title>Sequence Align Hits</title>
<h1>Sequence Align Hits with DP</h1>
Heuristic search versus dynamic programming, where this display show the results of 
dynamic programming (DP):
<ul>
<li>Hits were assigned to sequences using heuristic search programs such as <tt>Blast</tt>, <tt>Diamond</tt>, 
or <tt>Ublast</tt> when the database was build, and
their coordinates stored in the database; any references to 'Hit' indicate these coordinates.
<li>Dynamic programming is a slower search, but is considered more likely to get the correct alignment;
this display uses a semi-global dynamic programming with 
affine gaps algorithm. 
<li>In the display, the percentage after "AA" is the similarity for the dynamic programming algorithm. The statistics
after "Hit:" are from the search program results.
</ul>

<h2>Second row of buttons</h2>
<p><b>View Bases</b> changes the display from a line drawing to the actual sequence.
<p><b>Zoom</b> changes the horizontal zoom.

<p><b>UTR</b> Highlights the UTRs in yellow (nucleotide databases only). 
<br><i>Caveats:</i> The UTRs are not displayed if the RF is not the selected frame (this happens if there are hits
in multiple frames). The UTR is not displayed for nucleotide hits. This is not
available for "Selected hit(s) in all frames".

<p><b>Hit</b> Highlights the region from the start to end using the sequence hit coordiates; if the
sequence is nucleotide, they are 
are converted to protein coordinates and shifted to take account of the gaps.

<br><i>Caveats:</i>  (1) The alignment are occassionally off by plus one. (2) This is not
available for "Selected hit(s) in all frames".

<p><b>Alignment....</b> 
This features requires that one of the alignment boxes be selected (anywhere in the rectangle). 
It pops up with the following options (see last section for definition of terms):
<ol>
<li><b>Original semi-global  with affine gaps</b>: This shows the same alignment as
you would see by selected <b>View Bases</b>, but its easier to read since its
multi-line. Plus, you can simultaneously view where the alignment is on the graphical
view.
<li><b>Local</b>: This uses the "Gap" penalty, and does not try to cluster gaps.
<li><b>Local with affine gaps</b>: This uses both the "Gap" and the "extend" penalties
and tries to reduce the number of gap stretches.
</ol>
<p>The "Score" on the alignment popup is computed differently for local versus semi-global.

<p>If you compare the alignment with the UniProt alignment for the selected sequence-hit pair, there may be
some variation as it all depends on the Blosum matrix used and penalties set.

<h2>Dynamic programming sequence alignment terms</h2>

<ol>
<li><b>Semi-global</b> find the alignment of the entire
shorter string to the longer string. This works
fine if they are almost the exact same gene.
<li><b>Local</b> find the best substring in one sequence that aligns well with a substring in the other.
<li><b>Affine gaps</b> instructs the algorithm to cluster gaps if possible
instead of having them spread out. A simple nucleotide example is:
<pre>
--TCT-GAGG    or    TCT---GAGG
TATCTAGAGG          TATCTAGAGG
Two gap opens       One gap open
</pre>
<li>The <b>gap penalty</b> is the cost of
opening up a gap and the affine extend is the penalty for extending a gap.
</ol>

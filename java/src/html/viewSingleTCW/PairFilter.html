<h1>Pairs Filters</h1>
If the "Sequence Pairs" box is checked, all the filters are applied; otherwise, none of them
are applied. The filters are based on the results of aligning the sequences
using dynamic programming. The sequences are aligned based on nucleotide sequences, then
amino acid sequences using their reading frame.
<ul>
<li><i>NT %Sim</i> - the number of match nucleotides divided by the alignment length.
<li><i>NT Len</i> - the alignment length, which does not include overhangs at the beginning or end.
<li><i>NT %Len</i> - the number of match nucleotides divided by the longest length.
<li><i>AA %Sim</i> - the number of match amino acids divided by the alignment length; 
both exact and amino acid substitutions (blosum scores > 0)  are considered a match; 
two stop codons are not counted
as a match.
<li><i>AA Len</i> - the alignment length, which does not include overhangs at the beginning or end.
<li><i>AA %Len</i> - the number of match amino acids divided by the longest length.
</ul>

<h1>Basic Filters for GO Annotation</h1>
<i>Overview</i>: 
Select <b>Search</b> to search for the string in the text box, or select <b>Filters</b> to apply the
filters set. Select a check box or radio button to enable the associated search or filter.
<p>This is the main interface for queries related to gene ontology.
See <b>GO Help</b> for a description of terms. First, a few facts:
<ol>
<li>A GO ID is only in the TCW database if it has an assigned or inherited hit. 
<li>The Gene Ontology is constantly evolving, hence, TCW will only be consistent with
the Gene Ontology if TCW was built with the latest GO database from 
www.geneontology.org (the GO version is listed in the <b>Overview</b> panel).
</ol>

<hr>
<h2>Search</h2>
<ul>
<li><b>GO ID </b>&nbsp;&nbsp;The GO number, e.g. GO:0003674, or 3674. 
(<i>Must use one of these formats!</i>). Only one GO ID is allowed unless loaded from file.
<li><b>GO Name </b>&nbsp;&nbsp;All GO names are searched for the substring.
</ul>
<b>Load File</b>: 
<ul>
<li>The file should contain one GO ID or one GO Name per line,
depending on whether <b>GO ID</b> or <b>GO Name</b> is selected. <i>GO Name and GO ID must
be the exact text when loaded from file</i>.
<li>For <b>GO ID</b>, there can be additional information on a line; only the
first word will be taken as an ID.
</ul>
<hr>

<h2>Filters</h2>
<b>Seq-Hit:</b>
<table cellpadding=5>
<tr><td valign=top><b>E-value</b> <td>The best e-value is assigned to each GO. That is,
the hits are associated with zero or more GOs, and the sequence-hit pairs 
have e-values; this is the best sequence-hit e-value associated with the GO.
It will be the top hit on the <b>Show...</b> option <u>Sequence  - has Hit with GO</u>.

<tr><td valign=top><b>#Seqs</b><td> By default, this is the number of sequences with 
at least one hit with this GO assigned or inherited. See <b>#Seqs</b> section towards
the end, which explains how this will be different if the <b>DE #Seqs</b> is changed.

<tr><td valign=top><b>Evidence</b><td> Check the box, then select <b>Evidence</b> to bring
up a panel of available evidence categories.  The filter is passed if a GO
has <b>any</b> of the selected categories. See <b>Info</b> for the mapping of Evidence Codes
to Categories.
</table>

<p><b>Level:</b>  See <b>GO Help</b> for a description of levels. 
<table cellpadding=5>
<tr><td valign=top><b>All Ontology</b><td> This toggles between "biological_process" (BP), "cellular_component" (CC)
and "molecular_function" (MF).
<tr><td valign=top><b>Specific</b><td> Specify a specific level. Level 0 is obsolete terms. 
<tr><td valign=top><b>Range</b><td> Specify a range of levels. The highest level for the dataset will be the default
for the maximum.
<tr><td valign=top><b>Slim</b><td> If GO slims were identified when the database was created, this option will be present.
If checked, only the GO slims will be shown (plus filtered by any other option, e.g. E-value).
The type of <tt>GO slims</tt> is shown on the <b>Overview</b> panel, e.g. <tt>goslims_plant</tt>.
</table>

<p><b>Enrich:</b>
<br>If GO enrichment p-values have been computed,
you will see a row labeled <b>Enrich</b> on the main window; otherwise, ignore this section.
By default, the p-values are computed using <tt>GOseq</tt> package, see the <tt>Overview</tt> for the method.
<p>
Filter on the p-values as follows:
<ol>
<li>Check the box to the left of <b>Enrich:</b> and adjust the cutoff in the text entry
box on the right.
<li>This is followed by the word <b>for</b> and a button. This button will initially
be labeled <b>Any N</b> where N is the number of p-value columns. 
To change the selection, select the button which will bring up
a panel of all p-value column names; select the columns to query on. Choose one of the two
options for applying the cutoff, either:
<ol type="a">
<li><b>Any</b> shows results for which any of the selected p-value columns pass the threshold.
<li><b>Every</b> shows results for which all columns pass the threshold.
</ol>
<li><b>#Seqs</b>  see the <b>#Seqs</b> section towards the end of this Help.
</ol>

<hr>
<h2>Results</h2>
Select one or more filters, then click <b>BUILD</b> or <b>ADD</b> to execute the 
search, which builds a new table or adds to the existing table, respectively.
<p>Using the <b>Columns</b> button, columns can be added/removed. 
Columns can be rearranged by dragging and sorted
by clicking on a column heading. 

<p><b><i>Columns</i></b> 
<p>These are all obvious except for the following: 
<table cellpadding=5>
<tr><td>Ont<td>The GO Ontology (BP, CC, MF).
<tr><td>#Seq<td>See the <b>#Seq</b> section at end.
<tr><td>#Assign<td>The number of sequences with a hit that has the GO directly assigned.
This column is only relevant for understanding the data.
<tr><td>Best E-val<td>The Best E-value from all seq-hit pairs that have this GO.
<tr><td>Evidence Categories<td>
The "Long" format lists all evidence codes found for that category, where the inherited ones
are in parenthesis. The "Short" format only states "Yes" if it has one or more evidence codes
in the category, else its left blank.
<tr><td>P-values<td>See <b>Decimal Display</b> on upper left panel for their display.
</table>

<hr>
<h2>#Seqs</h2>
There are two occurrences <b>#Seqs</b> on this panel, and the second effects the column <b>#Seqs</b>. 
<ol>
<li><b>Seq-hit: #Seqs</b>: If this is set, the GOs displayed must
have at least this many sequences associated with the GO ID.
<br>&nbsp;
<li><b>Enrich: #Seqs</b>: 
<ul>
<li><b>All</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;The count is all Seqs with the GO, regardless of DE value. 
<li><b>DE</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;The count is all sequences with the GO that are considered DE for the selected set of p-values. 
<li><b>upDE</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;From the <b>DE</b> set, only the ones that are up-regulated.
<li><b>dnDE</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;From the <b>DE</b> set, only the ones that are down-regulated.
</ul>The relation between the GOseq p-value and when a sequence is considered DE is explained below
under <i>DE Sequence</i>. NOTE: when this is it set to something
other than <b>All</b>, it is much slower!
<br>&nbsp;
<li> <b>Column #Seqs</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; This is typically all sequences that have a hit
associated with the GO, unless the <b>Enrich: #Seqs</b> is changed from <b>All</b>.
<br>&nbsp;
<li><b>Seq Table</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;This shows the sequences that correspond with the <u>#Seqs</u> column 
in the table.
</ol> 
<i>DE Sequence</i>: Each sequence has the following annotations:
<ol>
<li>Sequence length.
<li>Zero or more hits, where many are associated with GO IDs.
<li>Read counts for different conditions along with DE p-values 
between pairs of conditions.
</ol>
<tt>GOseq</tt> uses all the above information to determine the over-represented GOs for
two conditions.
For input to <tt>GOseq</tt>, a binary vector is created of N sequences (where N
is the number of sequences with GOs); the value for a sequence is a 1
if it is DE, else it is 0. The scientist that executes <tt>GOseq</tt> via <tt>runDE</tt> sets 
the cutoff for DE, e.g. 0.05. The <b>Overview</b> panel under 
"Processing" states what the cutoff was, e.g. RoSt:0.05 indicates that the 
corresponding DE p-values
used a cutoff of 0.05. Hence, the DE count is the number that was used by <tt>GOseq</tt>
to calculate the GO p-value, where DE=upDE+dnDE. <i>TO BE CLEAR:</i> The #DE sequences
is not based on the cutoff from the panel, but based on the cutoff used for input to <tt>GOseq</tt>.
<p>If the <b>for</b> filter is on two or more conditions where "and" is used (e.g. StRo and StOl), 
the #Seqs=DE is an "or" of the individual conditions; it is done that way to account for 
the sequences that went into the GO P-values.
For example, try selecting #Seq=upDE, then select a row followed by <b>Seq Table</b>; at least one of the two
conditions will be up-regulated; however, on the <b>Basic GO</b> panel, both the conditions will
be &lt;Pval.

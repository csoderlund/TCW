<h1>Decimal Numbers Display</h1>
All options immediately change the decimal numbers in the main table, the Basic AnnoDB Hits, and
the Basic GO Annotation tables, except for the <b>Cutoffs</b>, which take effect when the <b>Apply Cutoffs</b>
is pressed.
<p>All parameters are saved between sessions.

<p>Decimal numbers (non-integer) are displayed using the following parameters:
<ol>
<li><b>E-notation</b>:  The number of leading digits for E-notation; e.g. 1.2E-2 
has 2 and 1E-2 has 1 leading digits. Minimum: 1, Default: 2.
<br>&nbsp;
<li><b>Significant digits (figures)</b>:  This is used for numbers &lt;1 that are not E-notation.
This is the number of important digits (see Wikipedia for a good description),
e.g. 0.012 has 2 significant digits. Minimum: 1, Default: 2.
<br>&nbsp;
<li><b>Decimal places</b>: This is used for numbers &gt;1 that are not E-notation. It is
the number of digits after the decimal point, e.g.
123.45 has two decimal places. Minimum: 1, Default: 2.
</ol>

<ul>
<li><b>E-notation</b>: This allows the user to set how big or small 
the <i>absolute value</i> of the 
number can be before switching to E-notation. 
Note, E-notation is scientific notation where 'E' is used to represent the exponent.
To view all numbers without using E-notation, enter 1E+20 and 0 in the two boxes, respectively.
To view all numbers in E-notation, enter 1 in both boxes.
<br>Defaults: 999999.9 and 0.01
<br>&nbsp;
<li><b>Java defaults</b>: Java determines when to switch to E-notation.
</ul>

Highlight good p-values: (only available if p-values exist in sTCWdb)
<ul>
<li><b>Highlight good p-values</b>: Turn this option on/off.  
<br>&nbsp;
<li><b>Color Schemes [1-4]</b>: Select any of the 4 color schemes, where the color (A-D) corresponds
to the cutoffs. For example, if color scheme 1 is selected and cutoff A is 0.05, 
a p-value will be highlighted light brown if it is &lt;0.05.
<br>&nbsp;
<li><b>Cutoffs</b>: Change the cutoffs with the restriction that A&gt;B&gt;C&gt;D, then select <b>Apply Cutoffs</b>. 
<br>Any of 
them can be set to zero in order to be ignored, e.g. if you only want A and D to be applied,
set the other two to zero. The cutoffs correspond to the ABCD in the color schemes.
</ul>
<h3>Round-off</h3>
This is easiest to explain with an example: say you filter on p-value&lt;0.05.
Given default values for <b>Decimal Display</b>, all cells of the resulting table should be colored
and have values &lt;0.05. However, you will see values of 0.05 due to round off error:
<ol>
<li>If you look in the MySQL database, you will see that an 0.05 p-value will actually has a value like 0.0499590. 
<li>When it is rounded for display, it becomes 0.050. Even at 3 significant digits, it is 0.0500 due to rounding; it
requires 4 significant digits to view 0.04996.
<li>The filter is on the full value, which correctly determines that 0.0499590 &lt; 0.05.
<li>But when it is tested for highlighting, it is different between the Main and Basic tables, as discussed below.
</ol>
<b>Seq Table</b>:
<ol>
<li>The result is rounded BEFORE testing for highlight, so the rounded 0.05 cell will be white.  
<li>Changing the significant digits on the <b>Decimal Display</b> does NOT change the value or highlighting unless 
you refresh columns.
</ol>
Basic <b>AnnoDB Hit</b> and <b>GO Annotation</b> tables:
<ol>
<li>The result is rounded AFTER testing for highlight, so the rounded 0.05 cell while be highlighted. 
<li>Changing the significant digits to 4 on the <b>Decimal Display</b> will show it correctly as 0.04996.
</ol>

<h1>Top Row of Options for Anno Hits</h1>

<b>Seq Table</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Select a one or more hitIDs or seqIDs in the table, 
then select <b>Seq Table</b>.
The sequences will be shown in the main table, where you can select it to view the <b>Seq Details</b>.
<p>
<b>Align</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Select a one or more hitIDs or seqIDs in the table, 
then select <b>Align</b>. Each hit-sequence pair will be aligned; the resulting panel
will replace the visible panel, i.e. annoDB hits panel. <i>The alignment uses
dynamic programming, so the coordinates may appear different from the hit values.</i>
<p>
<b>Show...</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Select one sequence or hit, then select one of the 
following to get a popup window of the information:
<ul>
<li><u>Assigned GOs for hit</u>&nbsp;&nbsp;UniProt has assigned GOs to many proteins. This options
show the assigned GOs with their level and description. 
<br>&nbsp;
<li><u>All GOs for hit</u>&nbsp;&nbsp;All ancestors of a GO ID inherit the protein-GO
association. This option shows the assigned GOs (as the previous option), but also all
inherited GOs. See the <b>GO Help</b> on the <b>Basic GO</b> for a more detailed explanation.
<br>&nbsp;
<li><u>All columns of selected</u> All columns for the selected sequence or hit. A benefit of this window
is that the values can be copied to be pasted elsewhere, e.g. KEGG identifier.
</ul>
<p>
<u><b>Export...</b></u>&nbsp;&nbsp;This has the same first two items as <b>Show...</b>, but the results
are written to file. The "*" is at the end of each option indicates that there will 
be a choice between writing <u>All Info</u> or <u>ID only</u>; writing the "IDs only" is useful for loading in the <b>Basic GOs</b> panel to view.
<p>
<u><b>Table...</b></u> 
<ul>
<li><u>Show column stats</u>&nbsp;&nbsp;A window will pop-up with statistics for all numeric columns
that are displayed.
<br>&nbsp;
<li><u>Copy table</u>&nbsp;&nbsp;The table will be copied so that you can paste it into a file.
<br>&nbsp;
<li><u>Export table</u>&nbsp;&nbsp;A window will pop-up with a file chooser, and the table will be
written to the selected file.
</ul>

<h1>Results</h1>

<h2>Sequence Results</h2>
All labels on the left panel will be shown in this table. 
<ul>
<li>These are either table or sequence detail labels.
<li>A label representing a table
will include a ":", e.g. "Filter1:". 
<li>Removing a table label will remove any
sequence detail labels listed for it; the <tt>Summary</tt> contains the table label up to the ":"
and the sequence detail label listed under the table on the left panel. 
<li>The <tt>All Seqs</tt>, <tt>Find Hits</tt> and
<tt>Sequences</tt> labels do not have entries in the table, so any sequence detail label needs to be remove
individually or with the <b>Remove All Results</b>. 
</ul>
<b>Remove All Results</b>: All labels will be removed and the table cleared.
<p>
<b>Remove Selected Result</b>: Select a result followed by this option to remove it, 
or the label can be removed by selecting the 'x' by its name on the left.
<p>
Double-click a row will show its corresponding table or sequence detail. 

<h2>Pair Results</h2>
Only filtered tables are listed, which have a corresponding label on the left under <b>Pair Filters</b>. 
<ul>
<li>Removing a filtered table will remove all the alignments shown on the left beneath the filtered label.
<li>If the <b>Seq Table</b> is selected for one or more pairs, the resulting sequence table will
be listed under <b>Filters</b> and be listed on this <b>Results</b> page.
</ul>
<b>Remove All Results</b>: All  Pair labels will be removed and the table cleared.
<p>
<b>Remove Selected Result</b>: Select a label followed by this option to remove it, 
or the label can be removed by selecting the 'x' by its name on the left.

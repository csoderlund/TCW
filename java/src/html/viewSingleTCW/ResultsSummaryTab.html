<h1>Results</h1>
The table summarizes all existing filter tables, which are listed on the left under "Filters". 
<p>
This is most useful for 'Remove All Results' which will do just that,
i.e. all filtered tables will be removed.
<p>
Select a result to remove it with 'Remove Selected Result', 
or the result can be removed by selecting the
'x' by its name on the left.

Double-click a result to show its corresponding table.

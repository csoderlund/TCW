<h1>Results</h1>
The table summarizes all existing filter tables, which are listed on the left under <b>Filters</b>. 
<p>
This is most useful for <b>Remove All Results</b> which will do just that,
i.e. all filtered tables will be removed.
<p>
Select a result to remove it with <b>Remove Selected Result</b>, 
or the result can be removed by selecting the
'x' by its name on the left.
<p>
Double-click a result to show its corresponding table.

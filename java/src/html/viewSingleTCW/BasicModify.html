<h1>Modify</h1>
The buttons under the table select, highlight or modify the table, as follows:
<table cellpadding=8>
<tr><td><b>Delete Selected</b><td>Delete the selected rows from the table.
<tr><td><b>Deleted Unselected</b><td>Delete all rows that are NOT selected.
<tr><td><b>Select All</b><td>Select all rows in the table.
<tr><td><b>Unselect All</b><td>Unselect all rows in the table.
<tr><td><b>Highlight<sup>1</sup></b><td>Highlight any selected rows.
<tr><td><b>Clear</b><td>Clear any highlighting.
<tr><td><b>Sort by other list</b><sup>2</sup><td><i>Anno Hits only</i>. See footnote.
<tr><td><b>Select Query<sup>3</sup></b><td><i>Seq and GO only</i>. Run query and select results in current table.
</table>

<p><b><sup>1</sup> Highlight</b>: If some rows are already highlighted, this adds to them.
The benefit of highlighting rows is that they do not change on sorts or column moves.

<p><b><sup>3</sup> Sort by other list</b>: If changed from Hit list to Seq-Hit list or vice-versa (select or unselect
"Grouped by Hit ID"), will sort by the previous list.

<p><b><sup>3</sup> Select Query</b>: This runs the same query (search/filter) as BUILD and ADD, 
but does not change the rows in the table. It simply selects the rows in the table that intersect the query results.
This works with "Load File" too, which can be followed by "Highlight" in order to easily view a subset.

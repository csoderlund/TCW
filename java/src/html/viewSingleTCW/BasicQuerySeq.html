<h1>Basic Queries for Sequence</h1>

This provides some basic sequence searches; for more involved searches, use
the <b>Filter</b> bullet on the left panel.  This allows you to "build" a table
of results from multiple queries, which can be Copied to Clipboard, 
Exported, or view the individual sequences with "View Selected Sequence". 

<hr>
<h2>Search:</h2>

<p>
Choose one of four search modes and enter a string to search on.  
<ul>
<li><b>Seq ID:</b> Sequence name 
<li><b>Orig ID or Longest or None:</b> (1) Original name if Seq ID &#8800 Orig ID  (2) Longest read of contig
if assembled, (3) no query if neither of the previous. 
<li><b>TCW:</b> TCW Remarks are entered when the database is built; they provide information
on the ORFs, and if the sequence has hits in multiple frames.
<li><b>User:</b> User Remarks may be associated with each sequence (entered with <tt>runSingleTCW</tt>).
</ul>

<i>Search rules:</i> 
<ul>
<li>It first tries to find an exact match. If found, the results are listed.
If not found, it then tries to match the substring anywhere in the hit ID or description.
<li>To force it to match at the beginning of the string, enter a '%' at the end of the
substring, e.g. 'mitochondrial%' to match everything that starts with 'mitochondrial'.
NOTE: since '%' is a special character, it cannot be in a search string as a literal.
</ul>

<b>Load File</b>: The file should contain one Sequence ID per line (make sure <b>Seq IDs</b>
is selected), or one Remark per line (make sure <b>Remark</b> is selected). This performs an exact search.

<p>Click <b>BUILD TABLE</b> or <b>ADD to TABLE</b> to execute the search,
which starts a new table or adds to an existing table, respectively. 
<br>Columns can be added/removed (<b>Columns</b>), 
rearranged by dragging and sorted.

<h2>Columns</h2>
<table border=0 cellspacing=3 cellpadding=3>
<tr><td valign=top nowrap>TCW Remark<td>Assigned by TCW during ORF computation
<tr><td valign=top nowrap>User Remark<td>Uploaded by User.
<tr><td valign=top nowrap>Count<td>Total count from all conditions/libraries. 
<tr><td valign=top>Orig ID or Longest<td>See Search above.
<tr><td valign=top nowrap>Best HitID<td>The HitID of the hit with the best e-value.

<ul>
<li><b>View Sequence</b>: Select a one or more seqIDs in the table, 
then select 'View Sequences'.
The sequences will be shown in the main table, where you can select it to view the
'Sequence Details'.
<p>
<li><b>Copy...</b>: Select one sequence to copy to clipboard the SeqID, Best HitID, or Longest.

<li><b>Table...</b>: 
<ul>
<li>Copy table: The table will be copied so that you can paste it into a file.
<li>Export: A window will pop-up with a file chooser, and the table will be
written to the selected file.

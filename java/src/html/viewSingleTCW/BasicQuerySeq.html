<h1>Basic Queries for Sequence</h1>

This provides some basic sequence searches; for more involved searches, use
the <b>Filter</b> bullet on the left panel.  This allows you to "build" a table
of results from multiple queries, which can be copied to Clipboard, 
exported, or view the individual sequences with <b>View Selected Sequence</b>. 

<hr>
<h2>Search</h2>

<p>
Choose one of four search modes and enter a string to search on.  
<ul>
<li><b>Seq ID:</b> Sequence name 
<li><b>Orig ID or Longest or None:</b> (1) Original name if Seq ID != Orig ID  (2) Longest read of contig
if assembled, (3) no query if neither of the previous. 
<li><b>TCW:</b> TCW Remarks are entered when the database is built; they provide information
on the ORFs, and if the sequence has hits in multiple frames.
<li><b>User:</b> User Remarks may be associated with each sequence (entered with <tt>runSingleTCW</tt>).
</ul>

<b><i>Search rules</i></b> 
<ul>
<li>It first tries to find an exact match. If found, the results are listed.
If not found, it then tries to match the substring anywhere in the hit ID or description.
<li>To force it to match at the beginning of the string, enter a '%' at the end of the
substring, e.g. 'mitochondrial%' to match everything that starts with 'mitochondrial'.
NOTE: since '%' is a special character, it cannot be in a search string as a literal.
</ul>

<b>Load File</b>: The file should contain one Sequence ID per line (make sure <b>Seq IDs</b>
is selected); likewise for Orig ID, TCW (remark) and User (remark). <i>This performs an exact search</i>.

<hr>
<h2>Results</h2>
Select one or more filters, then click <b>BUILD TABLE</b> or <b>ADD to TABLE</b> to execute the 
search, which builds a new table or adds to the existing table, respectively.
<br>Columns can be added/removed (<b>Columns</b>), rearranged by dragging and sorted
by clicking on a column heading.
 
<p><b><i>Modify Table</i></b>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete Selected</b> and <b>Deleted Unselected</b>: 
The selected rows or unselected rows will be removed, respectively. The corresponding rows will
be removed from the other (not-displayed) list.
<li><b>Select All</b> and <b>Unselect All</b>: Selects and unselects all rows, respectively.
</ul>

<hr>
<h2>Columns</h2>
<table class=tablex>
<tr><td><u>TCW Remark</u><td>Assigned by TCW during <tt>runSingleTCW</tt> ORF computation
<tr><td><u>User Remark</u><td>Uploaded by the user with <tt>runSingleTCW</tt>.
<tr><td><u>Count</u><td>Total count from all conditions/libraries. 
<tr><td><u>Orig ID or Longest</u><td>See <b>Search</b> above.
<tr><td><u>Best HitID</u><td>The HitID of the hit with the best e-value.
</table>

<h2>Top row of options</h2>

<b>View Sequence</b>: Select a one or more seqIDs in the table, 
then select <b>View Sequences</b>.
The sequences will be shown in the main table, where you can select it to view the
<b>Sequence Details</b>.

<p><b>Copy...</b>: Select one sequence to copy to clipboard the SeqID, Best HitID, or Longest.

<p><b>Table...</b>: 
<ul>
<li><u>Copy table</u>: The table will be copied so that you can paste it into a file.
<li><u>Export</u>: A window will pop-up with a file chooser, and the table will be
written to the selected file.
</ul>

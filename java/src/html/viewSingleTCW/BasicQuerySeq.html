<h1>Basic Filters for Sequence</h1>

This provides some basic sequence searches; for more involved searches, use
the <b>Filter</b> bullet on the left panel.  

<hr>
<h2>Search</h2>

<p>
Choose one of four search modes and enter a string to search on.  
<table class=tablex>
<tr><td nowrap><b>Seq ID</b><td>Sequence name. Only one name is allowed unless loaded from file. 
<tr><td nowrap><b>Orig ID</b><td>(1) Original name if Seq ID != Orig ID  (2) Longest read of contig
if assembled, (3) no query if neither of the previous. 
<tr><td><b>TCW</b><td>TCW Remarks are entered when the database is built; they provide information
on the ORFs, and if the sequence has hits in multiple frames.
<tr><td><b>User</b><td>User Remarks may be associated with each sequence (entered with <tt>runSingleTCW</tt>).
</table>

<b><i>Search rules</i></b> 
<ul>
<li>By default, the search is for the substring anywhere in the ID or remark.
<li>To force it to match at the beginning of the string, enter a '%' at the end of the
substring, e.g. 'mitochondrial%' to match everything that starts with 'mitochondrial'.
To force it to match at the end of the string, enter a '%' at the beginning of the string.
NOTE: since '%' is a special character, it cannot be in a search string as a literal.
</ul>

<b>Load File</b>: 
<ul>
<li>Select the search mode: <b>Seq ID</b>, <b>Orig ID</b>, <b>TCW</b> or <b>User</b>.
<li>The file should contain one search item per line. <i>This performs an exact search</i>.
<li>For <b>Seq ID</b> and <b>Orig ID</b>, there can be additional information on a line; only the
first word will be taken as an ID.
</ul>

<hr>
<h2>Results</h2>
Select one or more filters, the select one of the following:
<table class=tablex>
<tr><td><b>BUILD</b><td>Builds a new table. 
<tr><td><b>ADD</b><td>Adds any new rows to the existing table.
</table>
<b>Columns</b>: This will bring up a panel of columns, which can be selected or deselected,
and the results will immediately be changed in the table after <b>Accept</b>.
<p>A column can be moved by selecting the heading and moving it. Click the column heading to
sort it.
 
<hr>
<h2>Columns</h2>
<table class=tablex>
<tr><td><u>TCW Remark</u><td>Assigned by TCW during <tt>runSingleTCW</tt> ORF computation. See last section.
<tr><td><u>User Remark</u><td>Uploaded by the user with <tt>runSingleTCW</tt>.
<tr><td><u>Count</u><td>Total count from all conditions/libraries. 
<tr><td><u>Orig ID or Longest</u><td>See <b>Search</b> above.
<tr><td><u>Best HitID</u><td>The HitID of the hit with the best e-value.
</table>

<hr>
<h2>TCW Remark Legend</h2>
<table class=tablex>
<tr><td>ORF=Hit<td>The ORF has the same coordinates as the hit.
<tr><td>ORF=Hit+<td>The ORF has the same coordinates as the hit and Start and Stop codons.
<tr><td>ORF&gt;Hit<td>The Hit is contained in the ORF.
<tr><td>ORF&lt;Hit<td>The ORF is contained in the Hit.
<tr><td>ORF~Hit<td>The ORF coordinates overlap the Hit.
<tr><td valign=top>$<td>The dollar sign may be appended to any of the ORF remarks above, which indicates that the ORF has a Hit, is the longest,
and has the best Markov score (there will not be a ORF!Lg or ORF!Mk).
<tr><td valign=top>ORF!Lg<td>The ORF is not the longest in comparison with the other 5 frames.
<tr><td valign=top>ORF!Mk<td>The ORF does not have the best Markov score in comparison with the other 5 frames.

<tr><td>!5!3<td>No Start or Stop codon.
<tr><td>!5<td>No Start codon.
<tr><td>!3<td>No Stop codon.

<tr><td>ORF!Hit<td>The ORF frame is not the same as the Hit frame.
<tr><td>ORF&gt;=9Ns<td>There are &gt;=9Ns in the ORF.
<tr><td valign=top>ORF:AN<td>Typically, the BS (Best Bits) hit is used. But if the BS is a nucleotide hit, then
the AN (Best Annotation) hit is used.
<tr><td nowrap>Multi-frame<td>Hits to multiple different frames
<tr><td>StopHit<i>n</i><td>Stops in best hit, where <i>n</i> is the number of Stops found.

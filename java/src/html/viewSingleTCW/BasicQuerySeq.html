<h1>Basic Filters for Sequence</h1>

This provides some basic sequence searches; for more involved searches, use
the <b>Filter</b> bullet on the left panel.  

<hr>
<h2>Search</h2>

<p>
Choose one of four search modes and enter a string to search on.  
<table class=tablex>
<tr><td nowrap><b>Seq ID</b><td>Sequence name. Only one name is allowed unless loaded from file. 
<tr><td nowrap valign="top"><b>Orig ID</b> or <b>Longest</b>: <td>Either (1) Original name if Seq ID != Orig ID, or  (2) Longest read of contig
if assembled. If neither condition is met, then neither option will be available.
<tr><td valign="top"><b>TCW</b><td>TCW Remarks are entered when the database is built; they provide information
on the ORFs, and if the sequence has hits in multiple frames.
<tr><td><b>User</b><td>User Remarks may be associated with each sequence (entered with <tt>runSingleTCW</tt>).
</table>

<b><i>Search rules</i></b> 
<ul>
<li>By default, the search is for the substring anywhere in the ID or remark.
<li>To force it to match at the beginning of the string, enter a '%' at the end of the
substring, e.g. 'mitochondrial%' to match everything that starts with 'mitochondrial'.
To force it to match at the end of the string, enter a '%' at the beginning of the string.
NOTE: since '%' is a special character, it cannot be in a search string as a literal.
</ul>

<b>Load File</b>: 
<ul>
<li>Select the search mode: <b>Seq ID</b>, <b>Orig ID</b>, <b>TCW</b> or <b>User</b>.
<li>The file should contain one search item per line. <i>This performs an exact search</i>.
<li>For <b>Seq ID</b> and <b>Orig ID</b>, there can be additional information on a line; only the
first word will be taken as an ID.
</ul>

<hr>
<h2>Results</h2>
Select one or more filters, the select one of the following:
<table class=tablex>
<tr><td><b>BUILD</b><td>Builds a new table. 
<tr><td><b>ADD</b><td>Adds any new rows to the existing table.
</table>
<b>Columns</b>: This will bring up a panel of columns, which can be selected or deselected,
and the results will immediately be changed in the table after <b>Accept</b>.
<p>A column can be moved by selecting the heading and moving it. Click the column heading to
sort it.

<h2>Columns</h2>
<table class=tablex>
<tr><td><u>TCW Remark</u><td>Assigned by TCW during <tt>runSingleTCW</tt> ORF computation. See <u>TCW Remark</u> in <b>Help</b> drop-down.

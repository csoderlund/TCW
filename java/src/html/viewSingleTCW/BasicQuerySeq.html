<h1>Basic Queries for Sequence</h1>

This provides some basic sequence searches; for more involved searches, use
the <b>Filter</b> bullet on the left panel.  This allows you to "build" a table
of results from multiple queries, which can be Copied to Clipboard, 
Exported, or view the individual sequences with "View Selected Sequence". 
<ul>
<p>
Choose one of three search modes and enter a string to search on.  
<ul>
<li><b>Seq ID:</b> Sequence name 
<li><b>TCW:</b> TCW Remarks are entered when the database is built; they provide information
on the ORFs, and if the sequence has hits in multiple frames.
<li><b>User:</b> TCW Remarks may be associated with each sequence (entered with <tt>runSingleTCW</tt>).
</ul>
<i>Search rules:</i> 
<ul>
<li>It first tries to find an exact match. If found, the results are listed.
If not found, it then tries to match the substring anywhere in the hit ID or description.
<li>To force it to match at the beginning of the string, enter a '%' at the end of the
substring, e.g. 'mitochondrial%' to match everything that starts with 'mitochondrial'.
NOTE: since '%' is a special character, it cannot be in a search string as a literal.
</ul>

<b>Load File</b>: The file should contain one Sequence ID per line (make sure <b>Seq IDs</b>
is selected), or one Remark per line (make sure <b>Remark</b> is selected). This performs an exact search.


<p>Click <b>BUILD TABLE</b> or <b>ADD to TABLE</b> to execute the search,
which starts a new table or adds to an existing table, respectively. 
<br>Columns can be added/removed (<b>Columns</b>), 
rearranged by dragging and sorted.

<h1>Filters</h1>
Overall rules:
<ol>
<li>Set the desired filters, then select "View Filtered Sequences"; only the sequences
that pass all filters will be shown in the resulting sequence table. 
<li>Sections are collapsible; to expand a section to see its filters,
click on the "+". 
<li>
All filters correspond to columns with the same name in the same sections of the "Columns" tab
on the left.
<li>
TCW uses the terminology "every" and "any", but alternative terminology is:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;every = all = and = & &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; any = at least one = or = |
<li>A summary of the filters is shown at the top of the sequence table. 
Example abbreviations used:
"(U)" means Up, "(E)" is either, "&" is every, "|" is any.
</ol>
<h3>General</h3>
Filter on sequence length, total read count, and whether the sequence has
a user-added remark. Remarks can be added with the runSingleTCW interface.

<h3>Counts and RPKM</h3>
Filter based on counts or RPKM of one or more conditions, where RPKM is the default. 

<ol>
<li>Check either "At least N from every/any included condition" and/or "At most N from every/any excluded conditions".
<li>Select "every" or "any", where "every" required all conditions to pass the filter, "any" requires at least one
to pass the filter. 
<li>Enter the number of RPKM requires as the lower limit for the included condition and
upper limit for the excluded. 
</ol>
For example, say you choose Include=condA,condB and Exclude=condC,condD with the defaults.
This filter would results in a list of sequence where both condA and condB are >= 1.0
and both condC and condD are = 0.0.

<h3>N-fold</h3>
This applies to the RPKM columns. 
<ol>
<li>Check to turn filter on.
<li>Select a RPKM condition from the "Select 1" list and another condition from the "Select 2" list.
Then click "Add", which will add the pair separated by a "/" in the box on the right.
<li>Select "Up", "Down" or "Either", where the last shows both up and down N-fold.
<li>Set the number for N-fold, where the default is "2".
<li>If there are more than one pair selected (i.e. shown in box on right),
select "Every" if you want all pairs to pass the filter, 
or "Any" if you at least one to pass the filter. 
<li>To remove an N-fold pair from the box, select it followed by "Remove".
<li>To change the Up/Down/Either selection for an entry in the table, select the entry followed by "Change".
</ol>
How this works:
<ol>
<li>In order to <b>view</b> the N-fold values of <i>cond1</i> with respect to <i>cond2</i>,
use the "Columns" tab on the far left panel and set the N-fold columns to show 
cond1/cond2. Then display a table to view the results.
<ul>
<li>Positive and negative results for cond1/cond2: 
<pre>
If cond1&lt;cond2, the result will be -cond2/cond1 
If cond1&gt;cond2, the result will be  cond1/cond2
</pre>
<li>Since the divisor cannot be 0, a 0 is set to 0.1 before division.
</ul>
<li>To filter on <i>cond1</i> with respect to <i>cond2</i>,
set "Select 1" to cond1 and "Select 2" to cond2. If N-fold is set to 2:
<ul>
<li>If you select "Either", this filters on the absolute value
of the N-fold column so that both values &lt;= to -2 and &gt;= to 2 are shown.
<li>If you select "Up", then all positive results &gt;=2 will be shown. 
<li>If you select "Down",
all negative results &lt;= -2 will be shown. 
</ul>
</ol>

<h3>Differential Expression</h3>
This filter will only be available if the person who built the database ran
the function to add DE (Differential
expression) p-values to your database.

<ol>
<li>You must check the box next to 'p-value' and enter a p-value.
<li>You must select one or more DE values. Listed here will be the columns that were
added with the runDE function.
<li>Change 'Every' to 'Any' if you wish to see results where any of the selected DE values
meets the threshold.
</ol>
The database stores up/down regulation as positive/negative DE p-values, in which
case you will see options "Up/down/either" for each DE column. 
For example, if you select "Up", then you will see only results for which that p-value
has a <i>positive</i> value.

<h3>Best Hit</h3>
Every annotated sequence has both a "Best Eval" annotation and a "Best Anno" annotation.
If the database has GO annotations, there will also be a "Best With GO".
Selecting 'Annotated' shows a table of all annotated sequences. 
<p>If 'Annotated' is selected, then you must select 'Best Eval', 'Best Anno' or 'Best With GO' to be filtered on.
You may select additional filters, where the sequences in the resulting table must meet all of them for
the respective 'Best' assignment.  See Help on Basic 'annoDB Hits' for the definition of 'Best Anno'.
<p>All possible values of DBtype and Taxo are listed; if one of each is selected, the DBtype-taxo pair
must correspond to one listed on the Overview under "Annotation Databases".
<p>The "#annoDB" query is applied to the value in the column "#annoDBs" under "General" (see "Columns"). 
<p><i>Note: there are additional annotation queries under 'annoDB Hits'.</i>

<h3>GO</h3>

Enter a GO term, e.g. 3674 or GO:0003674, and all sequences that have this GO as assigned or inherited
will be displayed.  Additional
GO queries are available from the 'Basic GO Annotation'. 

<h3>SNPs and ORFs</h3>

Note, SNPs are only computed for assembled contigs, so SNP queries are not available for
imported transcript sequences. ORFs are computed in either case.

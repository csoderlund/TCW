<h1>Sequence GOs</h1>
See <b>GO Help</b> for explanation of terms.
<p>First four columns of table:
<ul>
<li><u>GO term</u>: The GO term identifier.
<li><u>Description</u>: The description from the GO database for the GO term.
<li><u>Type</u>: Abbreviation of top level: 'biol' is biological_process, 'cell' is cellular_component, 'mole' is molecular_function.
<li><u>Level</u>: A GO term can be at multiple levels in the tree. This is its maximum level.
</ul>
The remaining columns depends on the <b>GO...</b> pull-down view:
<ol>

<li><u>Assigned GOs for all hits</u> 
<ul>
<li><u>#:EC</u>: Each hit-GO association has a EC (evidence code). Each hit may have more
than one assigned GO. This list provides the number of hits with a given EC for the GO.
<li><u>Best Hit ID</u> and <u>E-value</u>: Of all the hits for the sequence with the GO,
this is the Hit ID with its best E-value. NOTE: The GO may be assigned to a hit for
the sequence,  but not necessarily to the Best Hit ID.
</ul>

<li><u>All GOs for all hits</u> 
<ul>
<li><u>Assigned</u>: If yes, then there is at least one hit-GO pair that is assigned.
<li><u>Best Hit ID</u> and <u>E-value</u>: Of all the hits for the sequence with the GO,
this is the Hit ID with its best E-value. NOTE: The GO may be assigned to a hit for
the sequence,  but not necessarily to the Best Hit ID.
</ul>

<li><u>Assigned GOs for selected hit</u>  
<ul>
<li><u>EC</u>: When a GO is assigned to a hit, it is assigned an evidence code.
</ul>

<li><u>All GOs for selected hit</u> 
<ul>
<li><u>EC</u>: If this is in parenthesis, it has been inherited.
</ul>
</ol>


<h3>GO Options - second row of buttons</h3>
<p>All five result in pop-up windows
of information, and the first three require a GO term to be selected:
<ol>
<li><b>Hits</b>: The sequence hits that have the GO assigned will be shown (hits will only be shown if the 'Assign' column is true).
<li><b>Ancestors</b>: The ancestors of the GO will be shown. The second column is the distance 
in the tree from the selected GO.
<li><b>Paths</b>: Displays a table of all paths of the tree for the selected GO.
Note: this can take a time to display as the tree has to be computed.
<li><b>Table</b>: This creates a popup of the table (slightly modified). It will stay active as you select other options.
<li><b>GO sets</b>: (Assigned GOs only) Different sets of GOs may be assigned to the different proteins
that hit the sequence. This shows how they group. For example:
<pre>
          Sets   1   2  #Sets
   #GOs in set   1   5 
    GO:0005829       X   1
    GO:0080045       X   1
    GO:0080043       X   1
    GO:0080046       X   1
    GO:0080044       X   1
    GO:0016758   X       1
#Hits with set  25   1 
</pre>
The first set only has one GO, and 25 hits were assigned the GO. The second
set has 5 GOs, but only one hit was assigned the 5 GOs.
</ol>

<h1>Seq Detail GOs</h1>
See <b>GO Help</b> for explanation of terms.
<p>First four columns of table:
<ul>
<li><u>GO ID</u>: The GO identifier.
<li><u>GO Name</u>: The term name from the GO database for the GO ID.
<li><u>Ont</u>: Abbreviation of the ontology (top level): BP is biological_process, CC is cellular_component, MF is molecular_function.
<li><u>Level</u>: A GO ID can be at multiple levels in the tree. This is its maximum level.
</ul>
The remaining columns depends on the <b>GO...</b> pull-down view:
<ul>
<li><u>Assigned GOs for all hits</u> 
<ul>
<li><u>#:EvC</u>: Each hit-GO association has a EvC (evidence code). 
This list provides the number of hits with a given EvC for the GO.
<li><u>Best Hit ID</u> and <u>E-value</u>: Of all the hits for the sequence with the GO,
this is the Hit ID with its best E-value. 
</ul>

<li><u>All GOs for all hits</u> 
<ul>
<li><u>Assigned</u>: If yes, then there is at least one hit-GO pair that is assigned.
<li><u>Best Hit ID</u> and <u>E-value</u>: Of all the hits for the sequence with the GO,
this is the Hit ID with its best E-value. NOTE: The <b>Show...</b> option will show all Hit ID/E-values for a selected GO.
</ul>

<li><u>Assigned GOs for selected hit</u>  
<ul>
<li><u>EvC</u>: When a GO is assigned to a hit, it is assigned an evidence code.
</ul>

<li><u>All GOs for selected hit</u> 
<ul>
<li><u>EvC</u>: If this is in parenthesis, it has been inherited.
</ul>
</ul>


<h3>GO Options - second row of buttons</h3>
<b>Selected:</b> The four <b>GO</b> options produce exactly the same output as their
counterparts on <b>Basic GO</b>.
<ul>
<li><b>Show...</b>
	<ul>
	<li><u>Seq Hits - assigned</u>&nbsp;&nbsp;Hits to the current sequence that have the GO assigned.
	<br>&nbsp;
	<li><u>Seq Hits - inherited</u>&nbsp;&nbsp;Hits to the current sequence that have the GO inherited. <i>This can
	take a few minutes for a high level GO</i>.
	<br>&nbsp;
	<li><u>GO - Neighborhood with relations</u> The immediate parents and children of the GO ID. 
The relation of 'is_a' or 'part_of' is shown for this option.
NOTE: same note as for descendants. 
<br>&nbsp;

	<li><u>GO - Ancestors</u>&nbsp;&nbsp;  All ancestors of the GO ID sorted by level. 
<br>&nbsp;

	<li><u>GO - Descendants</u>&nbsp;&nbsp;  All descendants of the GO ID sorted by level. 
NOTE: if a descendant  GO does not have any assigned or inherited hits, it is not in the
database so is not shown. 
<br>&nbsp;
	<li><u>GO - Ancestor path table</u>&nbsp;&nbsp;  
The same GOs as in the Ancestor List, but shows the paths in table form. If all paths have the 
same GOs at the top and bottom of the graph, they are only shown once and the row will be gray.
NOTE: Occasionally, this query may be slow when there are many paths for the GO; some GOs have over 1000 paths.
</ul>

<li><b>Export...</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; The exact same options as above, but the results are written
to file. When an "*" is at the end of the option, this indicates that there will 
be a choice between writing <u>All Info</u> or <u>ID only</u>. For example, if the <u>Hits - assigned*</u>
is selected and <u>ID only</u> is then selected in the popup window, the HitIDs will be written
to file; this is useful for loading in the <b>Basic Hit</b> panel to view.
</ul>
<b>Table:</b>
<ul>
<li><b>Show...</b>
<ul>
<li><u>Table columns</u>&nbsp;&nbsp;A copy of the table in a popup window. 
<br>&nbsp;
<li><u>GO sets</u>: (Assigned GOs only) Different sets of GOs may be assigned to the different proteins
that hit the sequence. This shows how they group. For example:
<pre>
          Sets   1   2  #Sets
   #GOs in set   1   5 
    GO:0005829       X   1
    GO:0080045       X   1
    GO:0080043       X   1
    GO:0080046       X   1
    GO:0080044       X   1
    GO:0016758   X       1
#Hits with set  25   1 
</pre>
The first set only has one GO, and 25 hits were assigned the GO. The second
set has 5 GOs, but only one hit was assigned the 5 GOs.
</ul>

<li><b>Export...</b>
<ul>
<li><u>Table columns</u>&nbsp;&nbsp;The table is written to file in a tab-delimited format.
<li><u>GO IDs only</u>&nbsp;&nbsp;The GO IDs are written to file, one per line.
</ul>
</ul>

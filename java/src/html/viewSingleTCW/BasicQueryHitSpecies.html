<h1>Species selection for DB Hits</h1>
The left panel lists all the species in the database, the right panel
shows the species to be included or excluded when 'BUILD TABLE' is executed.
<ul>
<li>Select one or more species in the left panel followed by "Add", and they will be added to the right panel.
<li>Select a species in the right panel followed by 'Del', and it will be removed. 
<li>Accept and BUILD TABLE: If 'Include' is selected, only the hits with the listed species will be displayed
in the table. If 'Exclude' is selected, only the hits that are NOT to the listed
species will be displayed. Note -- other filters will also be applied, e.g. from
the Attributes.
</ul>
A groups of entries can be selected by selecting the first one, and the last
one using Shift-Ctrl.
<h3>Modifying the left panel</h3>
<ol>
<li>One word: the list will be changed to show only the first word of each species,
followed by the number of species that have the first word, e.g. Drosophila (12).
When a species is selected followed
by 'Add', it is expanded in the right panel, e.g. Drosophila (12) will result
in 12 entries in the right table.
<li>Two words: same as 'One word', but the list is shown with the first two words.
<li>All: the complete species names are shown.
</ol>
<b>Find:</b> This is case-sensitive and searches the beginning of the species description.
For example, type 'Dros' followed by 'Find', and only the entries starting with 'Dros'
will be shown. To return to the full list, clear the text entry box and select 'Find'.

<h3>Accept/Discard</h3>
Accept will preserve the contents of the right and left panel, even if 
there are no species listed in the left panel. For example, if a 'Find' has been
run so only a partial list shows on the left, it will be shown again when the Species
panel is shown again.
<p>Discard returns the content to the left and right panel to their previous 
contents.

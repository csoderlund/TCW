<h1>Species selection for DB Hits</h1>
The left panel lists all the species in the database, the right panel
shows the species to be included or excluded when <b>BUILD TABLE</b> is executed.
<ul>
<li>Select one or more species in the left panel followed by <b>Add</b>, and they will be added to the right panel.
<li>Select a species in the right panel followed by <b>Del</b>, and it will be removed. 
<li><b>Accept</b> and <b>BUILD TABLE</b>: If <b>Include</b> is selected, only the hits with the listed species will be displayed
in the table. If <b>Exclude</b> is selected, only the hits that are NOT to the listed
species will be displayed. Note -- other filters will also be applied, e.g. from
the Attributes.
</ul>
A groups of entries can be selected by selecting the first one, and the last
one using Shift-Ctrl.
<h3>Modifying the left panel</h3>
<ol>
<li><b>One word</b>: the list will be changed to show only the first word of each species,
followed by the number of species that have the first word, e.g. Drosophila (12).
When a species is selected followed
by <b>Add</b>, it is expanded in the right panel, e.g. Drosophila (12) will result
in 12 entries in the right table.
<li><b>Two words</b>: same as <b>One word</b>, but the list is shown with the first two words.
<li><b>All</b>: the complete species names are shown.
</ol>
<b>Find:</b> <i>This is case-sensitive and searches the beginning of the species description</i>.
For example, type 'Dros' followed by <b>Find</b>, and only the entries starting with 'Dros'
will be shown. To return to the full list, clear the text entry box and select <b>Find</b>.

<h3>Accept/Discard</h3>
<b>Accept</b> will preserve the contents of the right and left panel, even if 
there are no species listed in the left panel. For example, if a <b>Find</b> has been
run so only a partial list shows on the left, it will be shown again when the Species
panel is shown again.
<p><b>Discard</b> returns the content to the left and right panel to their previous 
contents.

<h1>Sequence Table</h1>
Shows search results from <b>All Seqs</b>, <b>Filters</b> or any <b>Seq Table</b> button. 

<h2>Columns</h2>

<b><i>Add/remove columns</i></b>
<p>Change columns as follows: 
<ul>
<li>Select <b>Columns</b> link on the left panel. 
<li>Return to the desired table (selecting its tab on the left).
<li>Selecting <b>Refresh Columns</b> will redraw the table with the altered column selection.
</ul>

<p><b><i>Decimal Display</i></b>
<ul>
<li>The display of numbers and the color-coding of p-values can be changed in <b>Decimal Display</b>.
<li>Though the change is immediate, the values stay rounded according to the initial display.
<li><b>Refresh Columns</b> to apply the new rounding and/or color-coding. 
<li>See <b>Decimal Display - Help</b> for an explanation.
</ul>

<p><b><i>Sorting</i></b>
<p>
Columns may be sorted ascending or descending. Click on the header once for descending,
then again for ascending; or, right-click for ascending. <i><b>Note</b></i>: The DE columns have 
negative and positive values, where negative means the first condition has TPM (or RPKM) less
than the second. The sort on the DE column ignores the sign so the right click sorts all
DE to the top.

<p><b><i>Column re-order</i></b>
<p>
Columns may dragged to different positions, by clicking and dragging the headers.

<h2>Top Buttons</h2>
<h3>Seq Detail</h3>
This brings up a panel of the details of the selected sequence, i.e. hits, GOs, frame, alignments.

<h3>Refresh Columns</h3>
If the columns have been changed using the <b>Columns</b> label on the left, this button can be clicked
to update the table.

<h3>Table...</h3>
<u>Show Column Stats</u>:
Shows statistics for all numeric columns in the table. 

<p><u>Copy Table</u>: Copies the table to the clipboard, which can then be pasted into a file.
<p><u>Export selected rows of columns:</u> tab-delimited file of the selected rows from the table.
<p><u>Export table of columns:</u> tab-delimited file of the table.
<p><u>Export sequences from table:</u> fasta file of sequences for the seqIDs in the table. 
<p><u>Export translated ORFs from table:</u> fasta file of translated ORFs for the seqIDs in the table, 
where the translated ORFs correspond to the TCW selected frame and coordinates.
<p><u>Export library replicates from table:</u> combined file of library replicates for the seqIDs in the table
<p><u>Export hit sequences from table:</u> creates a file of the combined best hit sequences that are either:
<ol type='a'>
<li>Best Bits: the best bitscore per sequence.
<li>Best Anno: the best annotation per sequence.
<li>Both: all Best Bits and Best Anno hits.
</ol>
<p><u>Export sequences with Best GO:</u> creates a text file of all sequences that have a Best GO. The output
corresponds with the "WG GO" column, which is the best hit for the sequence with GOs assigned. 
<br>&nbsp;

<p><u>Export GOs from table...</u> list GOs associated with the seqIDs in the table along with the count (#Seqs)
of the number of sequences that have the GO (assigned or inherited). The output columns
are: GO ID, #Seqs, Level, Domain, Description and all p-values.
<ol>
<li>GO Level: 
<ol type='a'>
<li>Level 1 is the three domains. Level 2 are the GO IDs directly beneath
a domain, etc (see Basic GO Annotation 'GO Help' for more explanation). 
<li>If you leave this blank, it will output all GOs. 
<li>If you just want a couple of levels, e.g. 2 and 3, first export level 2, then export level 3
to the same file and use the append option (there will be a pop-up asking whether you want to append).
</ol>
<li>Any domain: This toggles through the three main domains. If you select one, it will only 
export the GOs in that domain.
<li>E-value: If you leave this blank, it will ignore the E-value. Otherwise,
this applies to each sequence-hit E-value where the hit has the GO. The #Seqs
column is the number of sequences that have at least one hit with the GO and its E-value&lt; the value.
</ol>
See <b>Basic GO</b> for more Export options.

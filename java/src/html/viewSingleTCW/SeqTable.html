<title>Sequence Result Table</title>
<h1>Sequence Result Table</h1>
Shows search results from "Filters" or "Show All". 

<h2>Columns</h2>
<h3>Add/remove columns</h3>
Change columns as follows: 
<ul>
<li>Select "Columns" link on the left panel. 
<li>Return to the desired table (selecting its tab on the left).
<li>Selecting "Refresh Columns" will redraw the table with the altered column selection.
</ul>
<h3>Sorting</h3>
Columns may be sorted ascending or descending. Click on the header once for descending,
then again for ascending; or, right-click for ascending. <b>Note</b>: The DE columns have 
negative and positive values, where negative means the first condition has TPM (or RPKM) less
than the second. The sort on the DE column ignores the sign so the right click sorts all
DE to the top.
<h3>Column re-order</h3>
Columns may dragged to different positions, by clicking and dragging the headers.

<hr>
<h2>Table...</h2>
<h3>Show Column Stats</h3>
Shows statistics for all numeric columns in the table. 

<h3>Copy</h3>
Copies the table to the clipboard, which can then be pasted into a file.


<h3>Export</h3>
The table data can be exported to a file with 6 different options:
<ul>
<li><b>Table of columns:</b> tab-delimited copy of the table.
<br>&nbsp;

<li><b>Sequences from table:</b> fasta file of sequences for the seqIDs in the table. 
<br>&nbsp;

<li><b>Translated ORFs:</b> fasta file of translated ORFs for the seqIDs in the table, 
where the translated ORFs correspond to the TCW selected frame and coordinates.
<br>&nbsp;

<li><b>Library replicates from table:</b> combined file of library replicates for the seqIDs in the table
<br>&nbsp;

<li><b>Hit Sequences from table:</b> creates a file of the combined best hit sequences that are either:
<ol type='a'>
<li>Best Eval: the best E-value per sequence.
<li>Best Anno: the best annotation per sequence.
<li>Both: all Best Eval and Best Anno hits.
</ol>
<br>
<li><b>Sequences with Best GO:</b> creates a text file of all sequences that have a Best GO. The output
corresponds with the "WG GO" column, which is the best hit for the sequence with GOs assigned. 
<br>&nbsp;

<li><b>GOs from table:</b> list GOs associated with the seqIDs in the table along with the count (#Seqs)
of the number of sequences that have the GO (assigned or inherited). The output columns
are: GO term, #Seqs, Level, Domain, Description and all p-values.
<ol>
<li>GO Level: 
<ol type='a'>
<li>Level 1 is the three domains. Level 2 are the GO terms directly beneath
a domain, etc (see Basic GO Annotation 'GO Help' for more explanation). 
<li>If you leave this blank, it will output all GOs. 
<li>If you just want a couple of levels, e.g. 2 and 3, first export level 2, then export level 3
to the same file and use the append option (there will be a pop-up asking whether you want to append).
</ol>
<li>Any domain: This toggles through the three main domains. If you select one, it will only 
export the GOs in that domain.
<li>E-value: If you leave this blank, it will ignore the E-value. Otherwise,
this applies to each sequence-hit E-value where the hit has the GO. The #Seqs
column is the number of sequences that have at least one hit with the GO and its E-value&lt; the value.
</ol>
See <b>GO Term</b> for more Export options.
</ul>

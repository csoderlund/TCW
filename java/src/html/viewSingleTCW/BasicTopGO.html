<h1>Top row of options for GO Annotation</h1>

<h2>Selected:</h2>
<ul>
<li><b>Seq Table</b> view the sequences in the main table for the selected GOs.
<br>&nbsp;
<li><b>Copy...</b> 
<ol type='a'>
<li><u>GO ID</u>&nbsp;&nbsp;select a row to copy the GO ID to the clipboard, which can be pasted elsewhere.
<li><u>GO Name</u>&nbsp;&nbsp;select a row to copy the GO Name to the clipboard, which can be pasted elsewhere.
</ol>

<li><b>Show...</b> For all relations (parent, ancestor, child, descendent), they are only in the database
if the GO has a direct assignment to a hit. Hence, for all the following, the relation is ONLY shown if its
in the database.

<ol type='a'>
<li><u>Hits - assigned</u>&nbsp;&nbsp; 
All proteins in the database that have this GO directly assigned to them.
<br>&nbsp;

<li><u>Hits - inherited</u>&nbsp;&nbsp; 
All proteins in the database that inherited the GO. 
NOTE: This query can be slow and the list long.
<br>&nbsp;

<li><u>Sequences - has hit with GO</u>&nbsp;&nbsp;
This shows the sequences that have a hit that has been assigned or inherited
the GO. The associated hit information is a bit confusing, but is as follows:
<ul>
<li>All sequences with the GO are shown regardless of their DE values. 
<li>If the evidence code is in parenthesis, the seq-hit inherited the GO.
<li>If the sequence has multiple hits with the GO, only the one with the best E-value
is shown. 
<li>In comparison to viewing the <b>Seq Table</b>, 
it only shows the sequence if the 'Best Bits' or 'Best Anno' has the GO.
This display shows all sequences with any hit that has the GO.
</ul>

<li><u>GO - Neighborhood with relations</u>&nbsp;&nbsp;
The immediate parents and children of the GO ID. 
The relation of 'is_a' or 'part_of' is shown for this option.
<br>&nbsp;

<li><u>GO - Ancestors</u>&nbsp;&nbsp;  
All ancestors of the GO ID sorted by level. 
<br>&nbsp;

<li><u>GO - Descendants</u>&nbsp;&nbsp; 
All descendants of the GO ID sorted by level. 
 
<br>&nbsp;
<li><u>GO - Ancestor path table</u>&nbsp;&nbsp;  
The same GOs as in the Ancestor List, but shows the paths in table form. If all paths have the 
same GOs at the top and bottom of the graph, they are only shown once and the row will be gray.
NOTE: Occasionally, this query may be slow when there are many paths for the GO; some GOs have over 1000 paths.
<br>&nbsp;
<li><u>GO - Related in table</u>&nbsp;&nbsp; 
A list of the GOs ancestors and descendants will be listed IF they are also in the 
displayed table. The GOs will be listed in the same order as found in the table.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<li><u>GO - Selected related in table</u>&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Same as the above "Related in table", but the rows are selected.
<br>&nbsp;
<li><u>GO - Selected ancestors in table</u>&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Select a GO, and the GO's ancestors will also be selected in the table.
<br>&nbsp;
<li><u>GO - Selected related in table</u>&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Select a GO, and the GO's descendents will also be selected in the table.
</ol>
<br>&nbsp;
<li><b>Export...</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; The exact same options as a-to-h above, but the results are written
to file. When an "*" is at the end of the option, this indicates that there will 
be a choice between writing <u>All Info</u> or <u>ID only</u>. For example, if the <u>Hits - assigned*</u>
is selected and <u>ID only</u> is then selected in the popup window, the HitIDs will be written
to file; this is useful for loading in the <b>Basic Hit</b> panel to view.
</ul>

<h2>Table:</h2>
<ul><li><b>Show...</b>
<ol type='a'>
<li><u>Show Columns Stats</u>&nbsp;&nbsp;A popup window of statistics for the numeric columns.
<br>&nbsp;
<li><u>Each GO parents with relations</u>&nbsp;&nbsp;For each GO in table, print its parents and relations 
(i.e. <tt>is_a</tt> or <tt>part_of</tt>)
<br>&nbsp;
<li><u>Set of ancestors</u>&nbsp;&nbsp;The combined list of ancestors for all GOs in the table, sorted by level.
<br>&nbsp;
<li><u>Longest paths</u>&nbsp;&nbsp;  The longest paths of the GOs in the table;
that is, shorter paths that are contained in another will not be shown. NOTE: This can take minutes
to compute and be large.
<br>&nbsp;
<li><u>All paths</u>&nbsp;&nbsp;All paths of the GOs in the table. NOTE: This can be a very large.
<br>&nbsp;
<li><u>Select terminal terms</u>&nbsp;&nbsp;Select the GO terms that have no descendents in the table.

</ol>
<br>&nbsp;
<li><b>Export...</b>
<ol type='a'>
<li><u>Table columns</u>&nbsp;&nbsp;A tab-delimited file of the contents of the table.
<br>If you just select two columns, (GO ID, #Seqs) or (GO ID, p-value), 
the exported file can be used as input to REVIGO (http://revigo.irb.hr). 
<br>&nbsp;
<li><u>Table columns with -log10(p-value)</u>&nbsp;&nbsp;A tab-delimited file of the contents of the table,
where any p-values in the table will be written as -log10(p-value), which is good for plotting in Excel.
<br>&nbsp;
<li><u>GO IDs</u>&nbsp;&nbsp;A single column file of only the GO IDs from the table.
<br>&nbsp;
<li><u>Export SeqIDs with GOs</u>&nbsp;&nbsp;A tab-delimited file of each SeqID followed by
its list of assigned and inherited GOs (from associated seq-hit list), where the GOs are from the displayed GO table. 
<br>This can be used as input to WeGO (http://wego.genomics.org.cn/) using native format.
<br>&nbsp;

<li><u>Create/Merge #Seqs</u>&nbsp;&nbsp;A tab-delimited file that contains
the GOs grouped by ontology, followed by the GO-Name and #Seqs. The merge
allows multiple columns of #Seqs based on different queries (e.g. two different
p-values).  The file must not be edited until
all #Seqs columns are added (TCW needs the format exact). The resulting file can
be used in Excel to make bar graphs.
<br>&nbsp;

<li>The next four option are the same as option b-e of <b>Show...</b>.
<br>&nbsp;
<li><u>Copy Table</u>&nbsp;&nbsp;Copy the table to the clipboard for pasting elsewhere.
</ol>
</ul>

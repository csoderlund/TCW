<h1>Top row of options for GO Annotation</h1>

<h2>Selected:</h2>
<ul>
<li><b>Seq Table</b> view the sequences in the main table for the selected GO.
<br>&nbsp;
<li><b>Copy...</b> to the clipboard, which can be pasted elsewhere
<ol type='a'>
<li><u>Go ID</u>&nbsp;&nbsp;from corresponding column
<li><u>GO Name</u>&nbsp;&nbsp;from corresponding column
</ol>

<li><b>Show...</b> 

<ol type='a'>
<li><u>Hits - assigned</u>&nbsp;&nbsp; 
All proteins in the database that have this GO directly assigned to them.
<br>&nbsp;

<li><u>Hits - inherited</u>&nbsp;&nbsp; 
All proteins in the database that inherited the GO. 
Each hit is associated with one descendant  GO; a hit may have multiple descendant 
GOs to the selected one (a note at the bottom of the
popup will say "Multiple Descendant GO Hits:" followed by the number). 
NOTE: This query can be slow if there are many descendant  GOs that have many assigned
proteins; some have &gt; 1000.
<br>&nbsp;

<li><u>Sequences - has hit with GO</u>&nbsp;&nbsp;
This shows the sequences that have a hit that has been assigned or inherited
the GO. The associated hit information is a bit confusing, but is as follows:
<ul>
<li>All sequences with the GO are shown regardless of their DE values. 
<li>If the evidence code is in parenthesis, the seq-hit inherited the GO.
<li>If the sequence has multiple hits with the GO, only the one with the best E-value
is shown. 
<li>In comparison to viewing the <b>Seq Table</b>, 
it only shows the sequence if the 'Best Bits' or 'Best Anno' has the GO.
This display shows all sequences with any hit that has the GO.
</ul>
<br>&nbsp;

<li><u>GO - Neighborhood with relations</u>&nbsp;&nbsp;
The immediate parents and children of the GO ID. 
The relation of 'is_a' or 'part_of' is shown for this option.
NOTE: same note as for descendants. Starting with sTCW v3.1.8, there is also a relation 'replaced_by'
and 'replaces'.
<br>&nbsp;

<li><u>GO - Ancestors</u>&nbsp;&nbsp;  
All ancestors of the GO ID sorted by level. 
<br>&nbsp;

<li><u>GO - Descendants</u>&nbsp;&nbsp; 
All descendants of the GO ID sorted by level. 
NOTE: if a descendant  GO does not have any assigned or inherited hits, it is not in the
database so is not shown. 
<br>&nbsp;
<li><u>GO - Ancestor path table</u>&nbsp;&nbsp;  
The same GOs as in the Ancestor List, but shows the paths in table form. If all paths have the 
same GOs at the top and bottom of the graph, they are only shown once and the row will be gray.
NOTE: Occasionally, this query may be slow when there are many paths for the GO; some GOs have over 1000 paths.
<br>&nbsp;
<li><u>GO - Related in table</u>&nbsp;&nbsp; 
A list of the GOs ancestors and descendants will be listed IF they are also in the 
table. The GOs will be listed in the same order as found in the table.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<li><u>GO - Selected related in table</u>&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Same as the above "Related in table", but the rows are selected.
<br>&nbsp;
<li><u>GO - Selected ancestors in table</u>&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Select the GO terms ancestors in the table.
<br>&nbsp;
<li><u>GO - Selected related in table</u>&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Select the GO terms descendents in the table.
</ol>
<br>&nbsp;
<li><b>Export...</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; The exact same options as a-to-h above, but the results are written
to file. When an "*" is at the end of the option, this indicates that there will 
be a choice between writing <u>All Info</u> or <u>ID only</u>. For example, if the <u>Hits - assigned*</u>
is selected and <u>ID only</u> is then selected in the popup window, the HitIDs will be written
to file; this is useful for loading in the <b>Basic Hit</b> panel to view.
</ul>

<h2>Table:</h2>
<ul><li><b>Show...</b>
<ol type='a'>
<li><u>Show Columns Stats</u>&nbsp;&nbsp;A popup window of statistics for the numeric columns.
<br>&nbsp;
<li><u>Each GO parents with relations</u>&nbsp;&nbsp;For each GO in table, print its parents and relations (e.g. <tt>is_a</tt>)
<br>&nbsp;
<li><u>Set of ancestors</u>&nbsp;&nbsp;The combined list of ancestors for all GOs in the table, sorted by level.
<br>&nbsp;
<li><u>Longest paths</u>&nbsp;&nbsp;  The longest paths of the GOs in the table;
that is, shorter paths that are contained in another will not be shown. NOTE: This can take minutes
to compute and be large.
<br>&nbsp;
<li><u>All paths</u>&nbsp;&nbsp;All paths of the GOs in the table. NOTE: This can be a very large.
<br>&nbsp;
<li><u>Select terminal terms</u>&nbsp;&nbsp;Select the GO terms that have no descendents in the table.

</ol>
<br>&nbsp;
<li><b>Export...</b>
<ol type='a'>
<li><u>Table columns</u>&nbsp;&nbsp;A tab-delimited file of the contents of the table.
<br>If you just select two columns, (GO ID, #Seqs) or (GO ID, P-value), 
the exported file can be used as input to REVIGO (http://revigo.irb.hr). 
<br>&nbsp;
<li><u>GO IDs</u>&nbsp;&nbsp;A single column file of only the GO IDs from the table.
<br>&nbsp;
<li><u>Export SeqIDs with GOs</u>&nbsp;&nbsp;A tab-delimited file of each SeqID followed by
its list of assigned and inherited GOs (from associated seq-hit list), where the GOs are from the displayed GO table. 
<br>This can be used as input to WeGO (http://wego.genomics.org.cn/) using native format.
<br>&nbsp;

<li><u>Create/Merge #Seqs</u>&nbsp;&nbsp;A tab-delimited file that contains
the GOs grouped by ontology, followed by the GO-Name and #Seqs. The merge
allows multiple columns of #Seqs based on different queries (e.g. two different
p-values).  The file must not be edited until
all #Seqs columns are added (TCW needs the format exact). The resulting file can
be used in Excel to make bar graphs.
<br>&nbsp;

<li>The next four option are the same as option b-e of <b>Show...</b>.
<br>&nbsp;
<li><u>Copy Table</u>&nbsp;&nbsp;Copy the table to the clipboard for pasting elsewhere.
</ol>
</ul>

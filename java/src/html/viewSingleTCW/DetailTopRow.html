The second row of buttons changes according to the option selected on the top row; it has its own
<b>Help2</b> on the second row of buttons.

<h3>Top row of buttons</h3>

<p>The display can be toggled between the following 4 (6 if assembled) options by selecting the appropriate
button:
<ol>
<li><b>Details</b>&nbsp; The sequence details, including the DB hits table.
<li><b>Contig</b>&nbsp; (assembled only) Shows the alignment of the reads/ESTs to the consensus.
<li><b>SNPs</b>&nbsp; (assembled only) Shows a panel of the SNPs.
<li><b>Frame</b>&nbsp; Show the sequence in frame, along with the location of the hit (if exists).
<li><b>GOs...</b>
<table>
<tr><td nowrap valign=top><u>Assigned GOs for all hits</u>
<td>Show the union of the assigned GOs to all hits for the sequence.
<tr><td nowrap valign=top><u>All GOs for all hits</u><td> Show the union of the assigned and inherited GOs to all hits for the sequence.
<tr><td nowrap valign=top><u>Assigned GOs for selected hit</u><td> Shows the assigned GOs for the selected hit. It also shows
the Interpro, enzyme EC, Pfam and KEGG identifiers assigned to the hit.
<tr><td nowrap valign=top><u>All GOs for selected hit</u><td> Shows the assigned and inherited GOs for the selected hit. 
</table>

<li><b>Align hits...</b>
<table>
<tr><td nowrap valign=top><u>Best Hit</u><td> Aligns the hit(s) displayed for the "Best hits (BS, AN, WG)".
<tr><td nowrap valign=top><u>DB hits: Selected hit(s)</u><td> Select one or more hits from the DB hits table to be aligned.
<tr><td><u>DB hits: Selected hit(s) in all frames</u><td> The hit will be aligned to all 6 frames of the

</ol>
The <b>Next</b> and <b>Previous</b> options goes to the next or previous sequence in the current

<h1>Decimal Numbers</h1>

There are two display options, both use the following two variables:
<ol>
<li><b>Decimal places</b>: This is used for numbers &gt;1. It is
the number of digits after the decimal point, e.g.
123.45 has two decimal places. Minimum: 0, Default: 2.
<li><b>Significant figures</b>:  This is used for numbers &lt;1 and E-notation displays.
This is the number of important digits (see Wikipedia for a good description),
e.g. 0.012 and 1.2E-2 both have two significant figures. Minimum: 1, Default: 2.
</ol>
Display options:
<ol>
<li><b>E-notation</b>: This allows the user to set how big or small 
the <i>absolute value</i> of the 
number can be before switching to E-notation. 
Note, E-notation is scientific notation where 'E' is used to represent the exponent.
To view all numbers without using E-notation, enter 1E+20 and 0 in the two boxes, respectively.
To view all numbers in E-notation, enter 1 in both boxes.

<li><b>Java defaults</b>: Java determines when to switch to E-notation.
</ol>
This is used for both the Sequence table display and the Basic queries. A few quirkiness:
<ol>
<li>Sequence table: When you change any of the values, the Sequence table will immediately be changed, i.e.
you do not need to redisplay the columns.
<li>Basic tables: When you change any of the values, the Basic table will <b>NOT</b> immediately
change, you must redisplay the table. 
</ol>

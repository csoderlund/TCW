<h1>Basic Filters for AnnoDB Hits</h1>

<i>Overview</i>: 
Check <b>Search</b> to search for the substring in the text box, and/or check <b>Filters</b> to apply
the filters set. Select a check box or radio button to enable the search or filter to its right.
<p>When the TCW database was created, the sequences were compared to zero or more 
annotation databases (e.g. UniProt taxonomic plant), which are referred to by
TCW as <i>annoDBs</i>. The comparison was performed with a <i>heuristic search</i> program 
such as BLAST or DIAMOND, where the results are referred to as <i>hits</i>. 
This panel allows searching against the set of <i>hits</i> to the sequences.

<p>The results can be toggled between the <i>Hit table</i>  and <i>Seq-Hit table</i>.
<ul>
<li><i>Hit table</i>: If <b>Group by Hit ID</b> is selected, then the table has one entry for each annotation (i.e. Hit ID), 
showing the number of sequences hit by that annotation, and the sum of count data for all of those 
sequences. 
<li><i>Seq-Hit table</i>: If <b>Group by Hit ID</b> is unselected, then the table shows each SeqID/HitID pair as a separate line. 
</ul>

<i>Beware: the list of sequence-hit pairs can
be over a million</i>  (see the <b>Overview</b> "Total Sequence Hits"). If you do not set filters
to reduce the size of the list, it can take a minute to display; you may also run out
of memory.

<hr>
<h2>Search</h2>
<ul>
<li><b>Hit IDs</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Identifier of the hit, e.g. UniProt ID. Only one Hit ID is allowed unless loaded from file.
<li><b>Descriptions</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Hit description, e.g. UniProt description string
</ul>
<i><b>Search rules:</b></i> 
<ul>
<li>By default, the search is for the substring anywhere in the ID or remark.
<li>To force it to match at the beginning of the string, enter a '%' at the end of the
substring, e.g. 'mitochondrial%' to match everything that starts with 'mitochondrial'.
To force it to match at the end of the string, enter a '%' at the beginning of the string.
NOTE: since '%' is a special character, it cannot be in a search string as a literal.
<li><b>Filters</b>: If this is not checked, then the query is only on the entered substring.
If it is checked, then any filters from are also applied.
</ul>
<b>Load File</b>: 
<ul>
<li>The file should contain one Hit ID per line (make sure <b>Hit ID</b> is selected)
or one description per line (make sure <b>Description</b> is selected).
<i>This performs a complete search, not a substring search.</i> 
<li>For <b>Hit ID</b>, there can be additional information on a line; only the
first word will be taken as an ID.
<li><b>Filters</b>: The filters will also be applied if the <b>Filters</b> is checked.
</ul>

<hr>
<h2>Filters</h2>

<p><b>Seq</b>: filters on values associated with the sequence.
<ul>
<li>Pull-down:
<ul>
<li><u>None</u>&nbsp;&nbsp;search all the seq-hit pairs; this will be a slow query as the number of pairs is typically
very large. 
<li>List hits that have at least one sequence where:
<ol> 
<li><u>Best Bits</u>&nbsp;&nbsp;The hit has the best bitscore over all annoDBs.
<li><u>Best Anno</u>&nbsp;&nbsp;The hit has the best annotation over all annoDBs.
<li><u>Bits&amp;Anno</u>&nbsp;&nbsp;The hit has both Best Bits and Best Anno over all annoDBs.
<li><u>Bits|Anno</u>&nbsp;&nbsp;The hit has Best Bits or Best Anno over all annoDBs.
<li><u>Rank=1</u>&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the best hit for the annoDB.
<br>If Rank=1 is selected with a given annoDB, it lists all sequences that have at least one hit from the annoDB.
</ol>
</ul>

<li><b>E-val&lt;=</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;The E-value assigned by the heuristic search program for
the sequence-hit pair.
<li><b>%Sim&gt;=</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;The filters on the "%Sim" column, which is the 
percent similarity assigned by the heuristic search program for
the sequence-hit pair.
<li><b>%HitCov&gt;=</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;This filters on the "%HitCov" column, which is the percentage of
the <i>hit length</i> covered by the <i>alignment</i>, where the <i>alignment</i> is the difference between 
the <i>hit start</i> and <i>hit end</i>.

<li><b>TPM/DE</b> A hit is listed if it assigned to at least one sequence that 
has the selected TPM (or RPKM) and/or DE p-values (if they exist in the sTCWdb).
</ul>

<p><b>Hit</b>: filters on values associated with the hit (e.g. protein).
<ul>
<li><b>AnnoDBs</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Show results from one or more annotation databases. 
<li><b>Species</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Show results from one or more species.
<li><b>GO, etc</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Has GO, KEGG, Interpro, EC and/or PFam (only exists if GO processing was performed). 
<ol>
<li>If <b>Has GO</b> is checked and no string is entered, all hits that have a GO will be shown.
<li>If a GO ID is entered, <b>Has GO</b> must be checked; all hits with the GO ID <i>assigned</i> to it will be shown. If only
the GO number is entered, the 'GO:' prefix will be added.
<li>The same two rules also apply to Interpro, KEGG, PFam, and EC. However, the GO search is exact,
where the rest are substrings, so it is best to enter the exact string, e.g. IPR027417.
</ol>
</ul>

<h2>Results</h2>
Select one or more filters, then click <b>BUILD TABLE</b> or <b>ADD to TABLE</b> to execute the 
search, which builds a new table or adds to the existing table, respectively.
Columns can be added/removed (<b>Columns</b>), rearranged by dragging and sorted
by clicking on a column heading.
 
<p><b><i>Columns</i></b> 
<ul>
<li>If <b>Group by Hit ID</b> is selected, this will show the <b>Hit Columns</b>;
otherwise it will show the <b>Seq Columns</b> (i.e. Seq-hit pairs).
The <i>Hit table</i> and <i>Seq-Hit table</i> have the same number of columns, and correspond as follows:
<ul>
<li>The Hit values such as "Description" are the same. 
<li>The "*" Hit columns are the best value from the Seq-Hit table. 
<li>The '#' Hit columns is the count of the corresponding Seq-Hit columns.
<li>The "+" Seq-Hit columns are directly from the heuristic search tabular file, or computed from them (e.g. <b>HitCov</b> uses the heuristic tabular columns of <i>Alignment length</i>,
<i>Hit start</i> and <i>Hit end</i>).
</ul>
<li>The Hit and Seq-Hit tables can have different column selections, but both column panels have an 
<b>Accept Hit/Seq Columns</b> to make one the same as the other.
<li>P-values:  See <b>Decimal Display</b> on upper left panel.
</ul>

<p><i>Heuristic search (Hit) values</i>: When the database was built, the sequences were searched
against the annoDBs using an heuristic search program (BLAST or DIAMOND); for simplicity,
the results are referred to as <i>hits</i>.

<p><b><i>Modify Table</i></b> 
<ul>
<li><b>Delete Selected</b> and <b>Deleted Unselected</b>: 
The selected rows or unselected rows will be removed, respectively. The corresponding rows will
be removed from the other (not-displayed) list.
<li><b>Select All</b> and <b>Unselect All</b>: Selects and unselects all rows, respectively.
<li><b>Sort by other list</b>: If a list has been sorted, and then <b>Group by Hit ID</b> is
check or unchecked, the other list will have retained its original
order. To order the 2nd list according to the 1st list, click this button. Beware,
the sort takes a while if the sequence-hit pair list is very large.
</ul>

<h2>Top Row of Options</h2>

<b>Seq Table</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Select a one or more hitIDs or seqIDs in the table, 
then select <b>Seq Table</b>.
The sequences will be shown in the main table, where you can select it to view the <b>Seq Details</b>.
<p>
<b>Align</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Select a one or more hitIDs or seqIDs in the table, 
then select <b>Align</b>. Each hit-sequence pair will be aligned; the resulting panel
will replace the visible panel, i.e. annoDB hits panel. <i>The alignment uses
dynamic programming, so the coordinates may appear different from the hit values.</i>
<p>
<b>Show...</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Select one sequence or hit, then select one of the 
following to get a popup window of the information:
<ul>
<li><u>Assigned GOs for hit</u>&nbsp;&nbsp;UniProt has assigned GOs to many proteins. This options
show the assigned GOs with their level and description. 
<br>&nbsp;
<li><u>All GOs for hit</u>&nbsp;&nbsp;All ancestors of a GO ID inherit the protein-GO
association. This option shows the assigned GOs (as the previous option), but also all
inherited GOs. See the <b>GO Help</b> on the <b>Basic GO</b> for a more detailed explanation.
<br>&nbsp;
<li><u>All columns of selected</u> All columns for the selected sequence or hit. A benefit of this window
is that the values can be copied to be pasted elsewhere, e.g. KEGG identifier.
</ul>
<p>
<u><b>Export...</b></u>&nbsp;&nbsp;This has the same first two items as <b>Show...</b>, but the results
are written to file. The "*" is at the end of each option indicates that there will 
be a choice between writing <u>All Info</u> or <u>ID only</u>; writing the "IDs only" is useful for loading in the <b>Basic GOs</b> panel to view.
<p>
<u><b>Table...</b></u> 
<ul>
<li><u>Show column stats</u>&nbsp;&nbsp;A window will pop-up with statistics for all numeric columns
that are displayed.
<br>&nbsp;
<li><u>Copy table</u>&nbsp;&nbsp;The table will be copied so that you can paste it into a file.
<br>&nbsp;
<li><u>Export table</u>&nbsp;&nbsp;A window will pop-up with a file chooser, and the table will be
written to the selected file.
</ul>

<h1>Sequence Details</h1>
<ol>
<li><b>Best ORF</b>: shows the RF (reading frame) and coordinates. A '*' indicates a missing start or stop. 
<li><b>DB hits table</b>: 
<ul>
<li>The columns "E-value, %Sim, AlignLen, Start and End" are from the first Search results for
 the hit (<tt>Blast</tt> or <tt>Diamond</tt>). 
<li>The column "Align" is in the hit coordinates (e.g. amino acids if the hit is a protein), whereas the Start and End in the sequence coordinates.
<li>The options GO..., Align... and Copy/Export... all have options that use
the DB hits table contents or selection.
</ul>
</ol>

<h2>Detail Options - second row of buttons</h2>
<ol>
<li><b>Counts</b> toggle: Toggles between counts, TPM (or RPKM), Replicates (if there are replicates).

<li><b>DB hits</b> toggle: Changes the set of hits listed in the DB hits table.
<ul>
<li><i>Best (EV, AN, GO)</i>.
<ul>
<li>EV is BestEval: The hit with the best e-value and bitscore.
<li>AN is BestAnno: Either (1) SwissProt, or (2) does not have terms like "uncharacterize protein". If neither exists,
it defaults to BestEval.
<li>WG is Best with GO: If GO is available, this is the hit with the best e-value and has at least one 
assigned GO term.
<li>The Best EV, AN, and GO may all be the same, or any two of them the same. They may not be in the list of "best per annoDB".
</ul>
<li><i>Best per annoDB</i>: In preprocessing, the sequences in the database are generally searched against
one or more annotation databases, which are referred to as an <i>annoDBs</i>. 
For example, the sequences
may have been searched against SwissProt Plants and TrEMBL Plants taxonomic databases. The best
hit for each is listed.
<li><i>Distinct regions</i>: A set of hits that represent the regions of the sequence for which
hits align to based on hit coordinates. Note the Start and End coordinates in the table, they will
not be the same, though may overlap some.
<li><i>Unique annotation</i>: Determines the unique descriptions, after filtering on: 
(1) ignore putative, hypothetical and predicted, (2) remove last character of description as often a number or letter.
<li><i>Unique species</i>: Lists one of each species that was hit
<li><i>Total</i>: All hits to the sequence. 
</ul>
<i>Note: sometimes its necessary to click in the window to get it to change the table, after changing the
DB Hits option.</i>

<li><b>Copy...</b>
This is a menu of options to copy content to the clipboard (to "Paste" elsewhere). The first two require 
a hit to be selected in the DB hits table. The last four copy the seqID or sequence.

<li><b>Export...</b> Writes a file of the sequence or DB hits.
</ol>

<h2>Pairwise...</h2>
The options displayed on the second row vary depending on the alignment type, and all refer
to creating a pop-up of the alignment in multi-row format.
<table border=1 cellspacing=3>
<tr><th>Type<th>Align Buttons
<tr><td>AA align</tt><td>Align...
<tr><td>NT align</tt><td>Align...
<tr><td>AA,CDS,NT</tt><td>AA..., CDS..., NT...
<tr><td>5UTR,CDS,3UTR</tt><td>5UTR..., CDS..., 3UTR...
<tr><td>AA to sequence best hit<td>Align...
</table>
<br><br>All pop-ups have the following option:
<table border=1>
<tr><td><i>Remove hanging sequence from ends</i><td> If checked, overhangs are removed. If uncheck,
the full alignment is shown, where is one extends further than the other, the gap character is
used to show the extension.
<tr><td>Display<td>The number of characters per row.
</table>
<p>Only the "AA,NT,CDS" and "5TUR,CDS,3UTR" alignment options also have the following. 

<h3>AA (amino acid)</h3>
<i>Display</i>:  60, 90 or 20 -- is the number of amino acids in a line.
<br><br>The 20 is equivalent to 60 for CDS. If you compare the two, they do not always correspond
because nucleotide gaps of 1 or 2 will cause a frameshift in the amino acid sequence, 
causing the amino acid sequence to be incorrect after the gap. 
A nucleotide gap of 3 is okay, as it will just cause a missing amino acid.

<h3>CDS (coding sequence)</h3>

<i>Display</i>:  60 or 90 -- is the number of bases in a line.
             
<br><br><i>Annotate</i>: With the following options:
<table border=1>
<tr><td>Match<td>Shows synonymous and non-synonmous mismatches.
<tr><td>Amino Acid<td>Shows the corresponding AA characters. Note: generally,
the AA characters will match with those shown on the "AA.." display. However, the CDS-NT
alignment is separate from the AA alignment, so the are occasionally different if gaps
have been inserted in the AA alignment.
<tr><td>Degenerate<td>Shows fourfold (4d) and twofold (2d) degenerate codons. Degenerate
codons code for the same amino acid, but 4d can have any of the 4 bases in the ith position
and 2d can have 2 or 3 alternative bases in the same position.
<tr><td>ts/tv<td>Shows ts (transitive) and tv (transversion) substitutions.
<tr><td>CpG<td>Shows the location of CpG dinucleotides with codon (but not CpG dinucleotides
that span codons).
</table>		

<h3>NT (nucleotide)</h3>

<i>Display</i>:  60 or 90 -- is the number of bases in a line.           
<br><br><i>Annotate</i>: Has the following options:
<table border=1>
<tr><td>Match<td>Shows a symbol for the mismatched nucleotides.
<tr><td>ts/tv<td>Shows ts (transitive) and tv (transversion) substitutions.
<tr><td>CpG<td>Shows all CpG dinucleotides.

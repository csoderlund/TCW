<h2>Multi-line Text Alignment</h2>
This refers to the multiple pairwise <b><tt>Align...</tt></b> and the three-way "Align:" 
<b><tt>AA..., CDS..., NT..., 5UTR..., 3UTR...</tt></b> options.
Selecting a '...' button results in a pop-up menu with the following options (depending on the view).
Once <b>Ok</b> is selected from the pop-up, a multi-line textual alignment will be shown; there is
a legend at the bottom of the window 

<br><br>All pop-ups have the following option:
<table border=1>
<tr><td>Remove hanging sequence from ends<td> If checked, overhangs are removed, where an overhang
is an extension of one sequence that the other sequence does not have. If uncheck,
the full alignment is shown. 
<tr><td>Display<td>The number of characters per row.
</table>

<h3>AA Align...  and AA...</h3>
<i>Display</i>:  60, 90 or 20 -- is the number of amino acids in a line.

<h3>NT Align... and NT...</h3>

<i>Display</i>:  60 or 90 -- is the number of bases in a line.           
<br><br><i>Annotate</i>: Has the following options:
<table border=1>
<tr><td>Match<td>Shows a symbol for the mismatched nucleotides.
<tr><td>ts/tv<td>Shows ts (transitive) and tv (transversion) substitutions.
<tr><td>CpG<td>Shows all CpG dinucleotides.
</table>
		
<h3>CDS...</h3>

<i>Display</i>:  60 or 90 -- is the number of bases in a line.
             
<br><br><i>Annotate</i>: With the following options:
<table border=1>
<tr><td>Match<td>Shows synonymous and non-synonmous mismatches.
<tr><td>Amino Acid<td>Shows the corresponding AA character for each codon. 
<tr><td>Degenerate<td>Shows fourfold (4d) and twofold (2d) degenerate codons. Degenerate
codons code for the same amino acid, but 4d can have any of the 4 bases in the ith position
and 2d can have 2 or 3 alternative bases in the same position.
<tr><td>ts/tv<td>Shows ts (transitive) and tv (transversion) substitutions.
<tr><td>CpG<td>Shows the location of CpG dinucleotides within codons (but not CpG dinucleotides
that span codons).
</table>		

<h3>5'UTR... and 3'UTR...</h3>

<i>Display</i>:  60 or 90 -- is the number of bases in a line.

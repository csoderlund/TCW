<h2>Instructions</h2>
The multiTCW database is created from two or more singleTCW databases. 
<ol>
<li>A dataset from a NT-sTCWdb will have both nucleotide (NT) sequences and amino acid (AA) sequences from
the translated ORFs. 
<li>A dataset from an AA-sTCWdb will have only amino acid sequences. 
<li>If an mTCWdb is created from a mix of NT-sTCWdb and AA-sTCWdb, it will generally be treated like 
an AA-mTCWdb in this interface.
</ol>

<b>Clusters</b>: There can be one or more clusters of type 
BBH (bi-directional best hit), Closure, BestHit (best annotation), orthoMCL
or user-defined.

<br><br><b>Pairs</b>: 
There is a pair for two sequences if they have a AA or NT hit (<i>pair hit</i>), where the hits are computed when
the database is created by searching a file of all sequences
in the database against itself using a heuristic search program
(<tt>Diamond</tt> or <tt>Blast</tt>). 
A NT-only database will have additional information for NT pairs in a cluster, 
such as number of synonymous, nonsynonymous codons.

<hr>
<br>A few general rules:
<ol>

<li><b>Filters</b>: Click a (Cluster, Pair, Sequence, Hit) filter on the left panel. 
Select your filters and click the "View Filtered" button, which results in
a table on the right and its <i>label</i> listed on the left. You can always go back
to the table by clicking its <i>label</i>.
<br><br>
<li><b>Samples</b>: All tables (Cluster, Pair, Sequence, Hit) can be quite large, hence, the
samples are a quick way to see the information provided in a table.
<br><br>

<li>Buttons highlighted in light blue result in a tab on the left. If the tab is from selecting
a single row of a table, then it will have a "&lt;&lt;" and "&gt;&gt;" to step through the table,
which replaces the current tab with a new one with the previous or next row.
<br><br>
<li>All panels have a <b>Help</b> to describe the options.
<br><br>
<li>All tables have a <b>Select Columns</b> that allows adding or removing columns from the table.
Putting the mouse over a column name in the panel shows its description in the lower left corner.
<br><br>
<li><i>Results</i>:
<ul>
<li>Results on the left can be removed by clicking the 'x' at the end.
<li><b>List Results</b>: Lists of all <i>results</i> under any of the ">" sections. They can all be removed
together by clicking the "Remove All", or remove only the selected results.
</ul>
</ol>

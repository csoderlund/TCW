<h2>Instructions</h2>
The multiTCW database is created from two or more singleTCW databases (datasets). 
A dataset may have both nucleotide (NT) sequences and amino acid (AA) sequences, or only 
AA sequences. If the database contains both NT and AA sequences, then the AA sequences
are the translated ORFs of the NT sequences.

<br><br><b>Clusters</b>: There can be one or more clusters of type 
BBH (bi-directional best hit), Closure, BestHit (best annotation), orthoMCL
or user-defined.

<br><br><b>Pairs</b>: 
There is a pair for two sequences if they have a AA or NT hit, where the hits are computed when
the database is created by searching a file of all sequences
in the database against itself using a heuristic search program
(<tt>Diamond</tt> or <tt>Blast</tt>). 
A NT-only databases will have additional information for NT pairs in a cluster, 
such as number of synonymous, nonsynonymous codons.

<hr>
<br>A few general rules:
<ol>

<li><b>Filters</b>: Click a (Cluster, Pair, Sequence, Hit) filter on the left panel. 
Select your filters and click the "View Filtered" button, which results in
a table on the right and its <i>label</i> listed on the left. You can always go back
to the table by clicking its <i>label</i>.
<br><br>
<li><b>Samples</b>: All tables (Cluster, Pair, Sequence, Hit) can be quite large, hence, the
samples are a quick way to see the information provided in a table.
<br><br>

<li>Clicking on a function in the table often results in another <i>label</i> on the left.
Functions that start with "Show" result in popup windows with the information.
<br><br>
<li>All panels have a <b>Help</b> to describe the options.
<br><br>
<li>All tables have a <b>Select Columns</b> that allows adding or removing columns from the table.
Putting the mouse over a column name in the panel shows its description in the lower left corner.
<br><br>
<li><i>Results</i>:
<ul>
<li>Results on the left can be removed by clicking the 'x' at the end.
<li><b>List Results</b>: Lists of all <i>results</i> under any of the ">" sections. They can all be removed
together by clicking the "Remove All", or remove only the selected results.
</ul>
</ol>

<title>Hit Table</title>

<h2>Hit Table</h2>
This table pertains to the annotation hits that are associated with each sequence.
<h3>Functions at the top</h3>

<u>Sequences</u> Select one or more hits followed by this function to view the sequences that contains
the hit(s).
<p>

<u>Pairwise...</u>  only one row can be selected
<table border=1 cellpadding=3>
<tr><td><b>AA for each pair of nSeq</b><td>Perform pairwise 
amino acid alignment for all nSeq sequences that aligned to the hit. 
<tr><td><b>NT for each pair of nSeq*</b><td> Perform pairwise 
nucleotide alignment for all nSeq sequences that aligned to the hit. 

<tr><td><b>AA each nSeq to its best hitID</b>
<td>For all nSeq sequences, align its best hit to the sequence.
<tr><td><b>AA each nSeq to the row hitID</b>
<td>For all nSeq sequences, align the row HitID to each sequence.
</table>
* NT-mTCW only
<br>The Pairwise options can result in many alignments,  e.g. if nSeq is 20,
190 alignments will be computed;  watch progress in lower left corner of viewMultiTCW.

<p><u>Copy...</u> For the selected hit, copy to clipboard a column (HitID or Hit Description).
<p>

<u>Table...</u>
<ul>
<li><b>Show Columns Stats:</b> Popup a table of statistics for the numeric columns in the table. Note: if you Export the table and 
compute the statistics, their results will not be as precise.
<br>&nbsp;
<li><b>Copy Table</b>: Copies the table to the clipboard either the entire table. 
<br>&nbsp;
<li><b>Export Table</b>: Exports the table to file. 
</ul>

<h3>Columns</h3>
<ul> 
<li>Put the mouse over a column name in the <b>Select Columns</b> interface, and a full explanation of the column is shown
in the lower left corner.
<li>Columns can be added/removed using the <b>Select Columns</b> button below the table. 
<li>Columns can
also be rearranged (by dragging the headers) and sorted (by clicking the headers). 

<li>One or more pair rows can be selected using mouse click, shift-click, or ctrl-click.
</ul>
The sections are as follows, where most columns are adequately explain with the mouse-over:

<table border=0 cellpadding=5>
<tr><td><b>General</b><td>&nbsp;
<tr><td valign="top">&nbsp;&nbsp;nSeq<td>The number of sequences that have this hit.
<tr><td valign="top">&nbsp;&nbsp;nBest<td>The number of sequences that have this as its best hit;
i.e. it will be shown for the sequences "Best Hit".
<tr><td valign="top" nowrap>&nbsp;&nbsp;E-values<td>The best E-value of all sequences for this hit.

<tr><td valign="top"><b>Hit Info</b><td>The associated info for the hit.

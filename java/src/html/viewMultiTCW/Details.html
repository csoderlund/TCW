<h2>Sequence Details</h2>

This is viewed from the Sequence table and provides information about the sequence.
It contains two sortable tables.

<h2>Pairs</h2>
This lists all seqIDs that have a hit with the sequence, along with any  shared clusters.
<h3>Hits</h3>
The top first hits from each type are loaded into the database when it is built, and listed here.
The only columns that need explanation are the following: 
<pre>
aaCov =  (Align/length of AA sequence)*100.0
hitCov = (Align/length of hit sequence)*100.0
</pre> 
The values can be &gt;100 when there are gaps in the alignment.
<br><br>
The <tt>Best</tt> column has:
<pre>
EV  = best e-value hit
AN  = best annotation hit
WG  = best hit with GOs
ALL = EV+AN+WG
</pre>

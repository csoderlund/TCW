<h2>Sequence Details</h2>

<h3>Details Panel</h3>

This is viewed from the Sequence table and provides information about the sequence.
It contains following two sortable tables:

<p><i>Pairs</i>:
This lists all seqIDs that have a hit with the sequence, along with any  shared clusters.
<p><i>Hits</i>:
The top first hits from each type are loaded into the database when it is built, and listed here.
The only columns that need explanation are the following: 
<pre>
aaCov =  (Align/length of AA sequence)*100.0
hitCov = (Align/length of hit sequence)*100.0
</pre> 
The values can be &gt;100 when there are gaps in the alignment.
<br><br>
The <tt>Best</tt> column has:
<pre>
EV  = best e-value hit
AN  = best annotation hit
WG  = best hit with GOs
ALL = EV+AN+WG
</pre> 

<h4>Selected: Copy...</h4>
<i>Pairs:</i> The first four options apply to the selection in the Pairs Table; if no
row is selected, the first row will be used.
<p><i>Hits:</i> The remaining options apply to the selection in the Hits Table; if no
row is selected, the Best Hit will be used.

<p><i>Clear</i>: Clear all selected rows.

<h3>Frame Panel</h3>
This replaces the current sequence panel with a display of the sequence; if it is 
a nucleotide sequence, then it shows information about the frame and best hit in relation
to the sequence.

<h3>GO Panel</h3>
This will only be available if GOs were added to the database when it was built with <tt>runMultiTCW</tt>.
<p>There are four options, where selecting one will replace the current sequence panel with a GO panel.
<table border=1 cellspacing=3>
<tr><td>Assigned GOs for hits<td>GOs that have been directly assigned to at least one of the hits.
<tr><td>All GOs for hits<td>Both assigned and inherited GOs for all hits.
<tr><td>Assigned GOs for the selected hit (or best)<td>All assigned GOs for the selected hit are shown.
If no row in the Hits table is selected, then the best hit is used.
<tr><td>All GOs for the selected hit (or best)<td>All assigned and inherited GOs for the selected hit are shown.
If no row in the Hits table is selected, then the best hit is used.

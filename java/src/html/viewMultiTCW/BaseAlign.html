<h2>Alignment</h2>
This <b><tt>Help</tt></b> applies to the <tt>View</tt>, <tt>Dot</tt>, <tt>Trim</tt>, <tt>Zoom</tt>,  and <tt>Blosum62</tt> buttons.

<p>
<b><tt>View: </tt></b> is followed by a toggle button:
<ol>
<li><b><tt>Line</tt></b> is a graphical view. A horizontal line covers the length of each sequence, where mismatches
are displayed as vertical (hash) lines.
<li><b><tt>Seq</tt></b> is a sequence view. 
</ol>
<b><tt>Dot</tt></b> (<tt>View: Seq</tt> only): When it is selected, a "." represents exact matches.
When it is un-checked, all characters are shown.
<p>
<b><tt>Trim</tt></b>: On pair aligns, trims the gray area at ends. On MSA align, it
also trims large stretches of initial gaps (the MSA programs can insert an occasional few characters in long string of gaps).
<p>
<b><tt>Zoom</tt></b> (<tt>View: Line</tt> only): The 1:N options shrink the image and the N:1 expand the image. The expanded
image has spaces between the individual hash lines, and makes the <tt>Zappo</tt> coloring easier to read.

<p>Blosum68/Zappo (AA only): This colors the hash lines and AA characters based on comparing the column amino acids with the consensus. 
<ol>
<li><b><tt>Blosum68</tt></b>: This uses the Blosum68 matrix, and is described in the alignment legend.  
<li><b><tt>Zappo</tt></b>: The amino acid residues are coloured according to their physicochemical properties, as is described in
the alignment legend.
</ol>
For both of the above, the hash line is longer if the Blosum68 matrix substitution value is &lt;0.

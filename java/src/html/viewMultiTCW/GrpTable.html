<h2>Cluster Table</h2>


<h3>Functions at the top</h3>
<ul>
<li><u>Sequences</u>:
Select a cluster or clusters followed by this function to view the sequence table 
of the members of the cluster(s). 
<br>&nbsp;

<li><u>Pair</u> Select a cluster followed by this function to view all pairs
that have a hit, which are computed when the database is created. 
The BBH and Closure clusters are guaranteed to have a
hit for all possible pairs in the cluster, however, orthoMCL clusters do not have this
requirement.
<br>&nbsp;

<li><u>Copy...</u>Copy to the clipboard the 
Cluster ID, Hit ID or Hit Description.
<br>&nbsp;

<li><u>Table...</u>
<ul>
<li><b>Show Column Stats</b>: Popup a table of statistics for the numeric columns in the table. Note: if you Export the table and 
compute the statistics, their results will not be as precise.
<br>&nbsp;

<li><b>Copy Table</b>: Copies the table to the clipboard either the entire table. 
<br>&nbsp;

<li><b>Export Table</b>: Exports the table to file in tab delimited file. 
<br>&nbsp;

<li><b>Export all cluster AA sequences</b>: Exports the AA sequences from all clusters in the table to a fasta formated file. 
The description line for each sequence provides the sequence and cluster name. 
<br>&nbsp;

<li><b>Export all cluster NT sequences</b>: Same as above but output NT sequences.
<br>&nbsp;

<li><b>Export Cluster GOs:</b> list GOs associated with the cluster sequences in the table. 
If any
sequence in a cluster has a hit with a GO the passes the below filters, the cluster is
counted as having the GO. NOTE: it does NOT use the Cluster "Best Anno Hit". The first three are filters::
<ol>
<li><i>GO Level</i>: 
<ol type='a'>
<li>Level 1 is the three domains. Level 2 are the GO terms directly beneath
a domain, etc (see GO annotations 'GO Help' for more explanation). 
<li>If you leave this blank, it will output all GOs. 
<li>If you just want a couple of levels, e.g. 2 and 3, first export level 2, then export level 3
to the same file and use the append option (there will be a pop-up asking whether you want to append).
</ol>

<li><i>Any domain</i>: This toggles through the three main domains. If you select one, it will only 
export the GOs in that domain.

<li><i>E-value</i>: If you leave this blank, it will ignore the E-value. Otherwise,
at least one sequence in the cluster must have a seq-hit E-value&le; this value.

<li><i>File Columns</i>:
<ol type='a'>
<li>Verbose: outputs columns 
<tt>
GOterm	#Cluster	Level	Term_type	Description
</tt>
<li>Count only: only outputs the <tt>GOterm</tt> and <tt>#Cluster</tt>. 
<br>This can be used as input to input to REVIGO (http://revigo.irb.hr)
</ol>
</ul>
</ul>

<h3>Columns</h3>
<ul> 
<li>Columns can be added/removed using the <b>Select Columns</b> button below the table. 
<li>Columns can
also be rearranged (by dragging the headers) and sorted (by clicking the headers). 
<li>Put the mouse over a column name in the <b>Select Columns</b> interface, and a full explanation of the column is shown
in the lower left corner.
<li>One or more cluster rows can be selected using mouse click, shift-click, or ctrl-click.
</ul>
<p> The following describes the columns that need more explanation then is provided by
the mouse over and shown in the lower left corner.



<table border=0 cellspacing=3>
<tr><td colspan=2><i>General</i>
<tr><td  valign="top">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taxa<td> Notation "nxN" where n is the number of distinct datasets included in the cluster,
where N=1 if all the species are represented by single sequences and N="N" if any of the
datasets have more than 1 member in the cluster.
<tr><td  valign="top">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;perPCC<td> If the Pearson Correlation Coefficient of the RPKM values
was computed during the database build, then this column contains the percentage that are >=0.8. See below for
more detail explanation.
<tr><td  valign="top">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Score<td>The average of the sum of each column, where the sum is the Sum-of-pairs score.
The Sum-of-pairs score compares each two characters in the column, where there are 22 possible characters (20 amino acids,
gap '-', and leading/trailing space ' '). The comparison scores are: (aa,aa) is the BLOSUM68 score, (aa,'-') is -4, (aa,' ') is -1,
('-','-') is 0, (' ',' ') is 0. A large score indicates greater similarity.
<tr><td  valign="top">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trident<td>The Trident score is computed by the MstatX package (//github.com/gcollet/MstatX).
This score is a function of normalized symbol
diversity, sterochemical diversity and gaps (reviewed in Valdir 2002, Scoring Residue Conservation). A score of '1' is the most
conserved.
<tr><td colspan=2><i>Majority Annotation Hit</i>
<tr><td  valign="top">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;%Hit<td>The percent of sequences that
have the majority annotation hit as one of its top hits.
<tr><td  valign="top">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HitID<td>The majority hit is 
computed based on initial substring of all descriptions of all sequences
in the cluster. The rest of the columns in the section are associated with this HitID.
<tr><td  valign="top">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nGO<td>(If GOs are in the mTCWdb) The number of
GOs directly assigned to the HitID.
</table>


<p>
<i>Percent pairs with PCC>=0.8</i>
<br>
For each pair that has a hit, 
the Pearson's Correlation Coefficient is computed from the
RPKM values of the conditions shared between the two sequences, where conditions are 'shared' if
they have the same name. The column perPCC is the percent of pairs that have PCC>=0.8. 
For example, if a cluster has 4 sequences,
it has (4*3)/2 = 6 pairs. If two of them have PCC>=0.8, then the perPCC will be 33%. A perPCC of
100% means that their expression profiles on their shared conditions are highly correlated. 
Select "Pairs" for a cluster to see the actual PCC values and "Sequences" to view the RPKM values.

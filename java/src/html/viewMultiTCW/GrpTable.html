<h2>Cluster Table</h2>


<h3>Functions at the top</h3>
<ul>
<li><u>Sequences</u>:
Select a cluster or clusters followed by this button to view the sequence table 
of the members of the cluster(s). 
<br>&nbsp;

<li><u>Pair</u> Select a cluster or clusters followed by this button to view all pairs
that have a pair hit, which are computed when the database is created. 
The BBH, Closure and Hit clusters are guaranteed to have a
hit for all possible pairs in the cluster, however, orthoMCL clusters do not have this
requirement.
<br>&nbsp;

<li><u>Copy...</u> Copy to the clipboard the 
Cluster ID, Hit ID or Hit Description.
<br>&nbsp;

<li><u>Table...</u>
<ul>
<li><b>Show Column Stats</b>: Popup a table of statistics for the numeric columns in the table. 
<br>&nbsp;

<li><b>Copy Table</b>: Copies the entire table to the clipboard. 
<br>&nbsp;

<li><b>Export Table</b>: Exports the table to a tab delimited file. 
<br>&nbsp;

<li><b>Export all cluster AA sequences</b>: Exports the AA sequences from all clusters in the table to a fasta formatted file. 
The description line for each sequence provides the sequence and cluster name. 
<br>&nbsp;

<li><b>Export all cluster NT sequences</b>: Same as above but output NT sequences.
<br>&nbsp;

<li><b>Export Cluster GOs:</b> List GOs associated with the cluster sequences in the table. 
If any
sequence in a cluster has a hit with a GO that passes the below filters, the cluster is
counted as having the GO. NOTE: it does NOT use the Cluster "Best Anno Hit". The first three are filters:
<ol>
<li><i>GO Level</i>: 
<ol type='a'>
<li>Level 1 is the three ontologies (top level). Level 2 are the GO terms directly beneath
the top level, etc (see GO annotations 'GO Help' for more explanation). 
<li>If you leave this blank, it will output all GOs. 
<li>If you just want a couple of levels, e.g. 2 and 3, first export level 2, then export level 3
to the same file and use the append option (there will be a pop-up asking whether you want to append).
</ol>

<li><i>Any Ontology</i>: This toggles through the three ontologies. If you select one, it will only 
export the GOs in that domain.

<li><i>E-value</i>: If you leave this blank, it will ignore the E-value. Otherwise,
at least one sequence in the cluster must have a seq-hit E-value&le; this value.

<li><i>File Columns</i>:
<ol type='a'>
<li>Verbose: outputs columns (GO is the column for the ontology abbreviation)
<tt>
GO-ID	#Cluster	Level	GO	GO-Name
</tt>
<li>Count only: only outputs the <tt>GO-ID</tt> and <tt>#Cluster</tt>. 
<br>This can be used as input to REVIGO (http://revigo.irb.hr)
</ol>
</ol>
<br>
<li><b>Export cluster counts (.tvf)</b>: For all sequences in all clusters, output the clusterID, seqID and counts.
<br>&nbsp;
<li><b>Export cluster TPM (.tvf)</b>:  For all sequences in all clusters, output the clusterID, seqID and TPM values.
(See TPM NOTE at end).
</ul>
<br>
The <b>Export</b> options will only be visible if the associated data in the database.
</ul>

<h2>Columns</h2>
<ul> 
<li>Columns can be added/removed using the <b>Select Columns</b> button below the table. 
<li>Columns can
also be rearranged (by dragging the headers) and sorted (by clicking the headers). 
<li>Put the mouse over a column name in the <b>Select Columns</b> interface, and a full explanation of the column is shown
in the lower left corner.
<li>One or more cluster rows can be selected using mouse click, shift-click, or ctrl-click.
</ul>
<p> The following describes the columns that need more explanation then is provided by
the mouse over that is shown in the lower left corner.

<table border=0 cellspacing=3>
<tr><td colspan=2><i>General</i>
<tr><td  valign="top">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taxa<td> Notation "nxN" where n is the number of distinct datasets included in the cluster,
where N=1 if all the species are represented by single sequences and N="N" if any of the
datasets have more than 1 member in the cluster.
<tr><td  valign="top">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;perPCC<td> If the Pearson Correlation Coefficient of the TPM values
was computed during the database build, then this column contains the percentage that are >=0.8. See below for
more detail explanation.
<tr><td  valign="top">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Score1<td>See the section at the end.
<tr><td  valign="top">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Score2<td>See the section at the end.
<tr><td colspan=2><i>Majority Best Anno Hit</i>
<tr><td  valign="top">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HitID<td>The majority hit is 
computed based on initial substring of all descriptions of all sequences
in the cluster. The rest of the columns in the section are associated with this HitID.
<tr><td  valign="top">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nGO<td>(If GOs are in the mTCWdb) The number of
GOs directly assigned to the HitID.
<tr><td  valign="top">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;%Hit<td>The percent of sequences that
have the majority annotation hit as one of its top hits.
</table>


<p>
<i>Percent pairs with PCC>=0.8</i>
<br>
For each pair that has a hit, 
the Pearson's Correlation Coefficient is computed from the
TPM values of the conditions shared between the two sequences, where conditions are 'shared' if
they have the same name. The column perPCC is the percent of pairs that have PCC>=0.8. 
For example, if a cluster has 4 sequences,
it has (4*3)/2 = 6 pairs. If two of them have PCC>=0.8, then the perPCC will be 33%. A perPCC of
100% means that their expression profiles on their shared conditions are highly correlated. 
Select "Pairs" for a cluster to see the actual PCC values and "Sequences" to view the TPM values.
<p>TPM NOTE: For pre-v3.0.4 releases, RPKM was computed instead of TPM.

<h3>MSA Scores</h3>
By default, <tt>Score1</tt> is the Sum-of-Pairs.The Sum-of-pairs score compares each two characters in the column, where there are 22 possible characters (20 amino acids,
gap '-', and leading/trailing space ' '). The comparison scores are: (aa,aa) is the BLOSUM68 score, (aa,'-') is -4, (aa,' ') is -1,
('-','-') is 0, (' ',' ') is 0. A large score indicates greater similarity.
<p>By default, <tt>Score2</tt> is Wentropy, as discussed in
the MstatX documentation (//github.com/gcollet/MstatX) and reviewed in Valdir 2002 "Scoring Residue Conservation"". 
A score of '1' is the most conserved.
<p>When the database is built, these defaults can be replaced with other methods from the MstatX package.
If this occurs, the explanation of the column in the lower left corner will tell what method was used.
<p>In all cases, the score is computed per column, and the values shown for <tt>Score1</tt> and <tt>Score2</tt>
are the average.

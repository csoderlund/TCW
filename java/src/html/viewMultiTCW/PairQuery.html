<title>Filter Pairs</title>
<h2>Filter Pairs</h2>
There is a pair for two sequences if they have a hit, where the hits are computed when
the database is created. This was accomplished by searching a file of all sequences
in the database against itself using a heuristic search program
such as <tt>Diamond</tt> or <tt>Blast</tt>. 

<p>
A pair must pass ALL filters. The filters selected will be shown at the top
of the resulting filtered Pairs table. Beware:
<ul>
<li>It is easy to forget to unset a filter, so execute "Clear"
to clear all filters in order to start a brand new filter. 
<li>If NO filters are set, all pairs will be displayed -- this can be a big
set and may take awhile to display.
</ul>

<h3>+Basic</h3>
Click the check box and enter the search value.
<table border=1 cellpadding=3>
<tr><td><tt>Pair #</tt><td> Search for the number shown in the <tt>Pair #</tt> column. This results in only
one pair being displayed.
<tr><td><tt>SeqID</tt><td>If the <tt>Seq ID</tt> of either sequence in the pair contains the given substring, the
resulting pair will be displayed. 
<tr><td><tt>Shared HitID</tt><td>If the assigned <tt>HitID</tt> of a pair contains the given substring, the
resulting pair will be displayed. 
<br>The <tt>HitID</tt> "*NoShare" indicates the pair does not share any description.
<br>The <tt>HitID</tt> "*Novel" indicates that neither sequence of the pair has any annotation.
<br>See the <a href=http://www.agcol.arizona.edu/software/tcw/doc/mtcw/UserGuide.html#pairs>online documentation</a>
for a detailed description of how the <tt>Shared Hit</tt> is computed.
<tr><td><tt>Shared Descript</tt><td>Displays all pairs that have the substring in the  description column. 
<tr><td><tt>PCC</tt><td> This is only relevant if there are TPM values in the database. The Pearson
Correlation Coefficient (PCC) is computed for all pairs to determine their correlation. 
</table>
<p>Substring queries (<tt>SeqID</tt>, <tt>Shared HitID</tt>, <tt>Shared Descript</tt>):
<ul>
<li>The search is not case-sensitive and will find the substring anywhere in the ID or description.
<li>The second two options have a <tt>Has</tt> and <tt>Not</tt> choice beside
them; if <tt>Not</tt> is selected, show all pairs that do NOT have the substring. 
</ul>

<h3>+Hit</h3>
<table border=1>
<tr><td><tt>AA pairs</tt><td> A 'yes' will display all pairs that have AA hit. A
'no' will display all pairs without an AA hit.
<tr><td><tt>E-value</tt><td> Select the radio button and enter the hit e-value to search on.
<tr><td><tt>%Similarity</tt><td> Select the radio button and enter the hit %Similarity to search on.
</table>
<br>The same three filters are available for the nucleotide (NT) search.
<br><u>NOTE</u>: A filter of no AA pairs and no NT pairs will always return zero pairs, as a pair must have
either an AA or NT hit to be pair.

<h3>+Statistics - only available if at least two NT datasets are in the mTCWdb</h3>
Selecting <tt>Has Stats</tt> displays the pairs with the corresponding statistics, which are the 
pairs that are in at least one cluster. 
 
<br><br>For <tt>&gt;=N and &lt;M</tt>: If N=M, then the query is on "=N". For example, if both values are 0, then
the query is for "=0".

<br><br><tt>Has Stats</tt>: All queries correspond to columns of the same name, e.g. "%Cexact" corresponds
to the column "%Cexact", where putting the mouse over the column name (in the column panel)
defines it in the lower left hand corner as "Percent of codons that have an exact match".

<br><br><tt>KaKs</tt>: This is the synonymous substitution rate (Ka) divided by the nonsynonymous
substitution rate (Ks). KaKs&lt;1 is considered purifying selection and KaKs&gt;1
is considered positive selection. If Kaks='-' then the overlap was too short to compute KaKs. 
If <tt>KaKs=NA</tt> is selected and <tt>KaKs</tt> value(s) are entered, the query is on either condition.

<h3>+Datasets</h3>
Select <tt>Different sets</tt> to only show pairs that are from different dataset,
and <tt>Same sets</tt> to only show pairs from same sets.
<p><tt>Pairs</tt>: If the mTCW database contains more than two datasets, then all pairs
of datasets are shown. If a pair is selected, then it will only search for pairs
that contain sequences from the two dataset. 

<h3>+Clusters</h3>
One or more clusters sets will be in the database. They will all be listed here
with an <tt>In</tt> to show pairs that are in the respective cluster, and <tt>Not in</tt>
to only show pairs that are not in the respective cluster.

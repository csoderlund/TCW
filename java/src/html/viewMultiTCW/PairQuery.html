<title>Filter Pairs</title>
<h2>Filter Pairs</h2>
There is a pair for two sequences if they have a hit, where the hits are computed when
the database is created by searching a file of all sequences
in the database against itself using a heuristic search program
such as <tt>Diamond</tt>, <tt>Blast</tt> or <tt>Usearch</tt>. 

<p>
A pair must pass ALL filters. The filters selected will be shown at the top
of the resulting filtered Pairs table. Beware:
<ul>
<li>It is easy to forget to unset a filter, so execute "Clear"
to clear all filters in order to start a brand new filter. 
<li>If NO filters are set, all pairs will be displayed -- this can be a big
set and may take awhile to display.
</ul>

<h3>+Basic</h3>
Click the check box and enter the search value.
<table border=1 cellpadding=3>
<tr><td><tt>Pair #</tt><td> Search for the number shown in the <tt>Pair #</tt> column. This results in only
one pair being displayed.
<tr><td><tt>Seq ID</tt><td>If the SeqID of either sequence in the pair contains the given substring, the
resulting pair will be displayed. 
<tr><td><tt>Best Hit ID</tt><td>If the assigned Best Hit ID of  pair contains the given substring, the
resulting pair will be displayed. 
<tr><td><tt>Description</tt><td>Displays all pairs that have the substring in the  description column.
<tr><td><tt>PCC</tt><td> This is only relevant if there are TPM values in the database. The Pearson
Correlation Coefficient (PCC) is computed for all pairs to determine the correlation of the
TPM values. 
</table>
<p>Substring queries (<tt>Seq ID</tt>, <tt>Best Hit ID</tt>, <tt>Description</tt>):
<ul>
<li>The search is not case-sensitive and will find the substring anywhere in the ID or description.
<li>The second two options have a <tt>Has</tt> and <tt>Not</tt> choice beside
them; if <tt>Not</tt> is selected, show all pairs that do NOT have the substring. 
</ul>
<h3>+Hit</h3>

<table border=1>
<tr><td><tt>AA pairs</tt><td> A 'yes' will display all pairs that have protein hit. A
'no' will display all pairs without a hit score.
<tr><td><tt>E-value</tt><td> Select the radio button and enter the hit e-value to search on.
<tr><td><tt>%Similarity</tt><td> Select the radio button and enter the hit %Similarity to search on.
</table>
The same three filters are available for the nucleotide search.

<h3>+Statistics - only available if all datasets have nucleotide sequences</h3>
Selecting <tt>Has Stats</tt> or
<tt>Has KaKs</tt> displays the pairs with the corresponding statistics. It depends on
how the database was built as to whether a pair has Stats or has KaKs. 

<br><br>For all queries that have a "&gt;=" and "&lt;", a blank entry will be ignored, but one 
of the two entry boxes must have a number if the corresponding check box
is selected. 

<br><br><tt>Has Stats</tt>: All queries correspond to columns of the same name, e.g. "%Cexact" corresponds
to the column "%Cexact", where putting the mouse over the column name (in the column panel)
defines it in the lower left hand corner as "Percent of codons that have an exact match".

<br><br><tt>Has KaKs</tt>: This is the synonymous substitution rate (Ka) divided by the nonsynonymous
substitution rate (Ks). KaKs&lt;1 is considered purifying selection and KaKs&gt;1
is considered positive selection. The KaKs value is given a p-value, which can also
be queried on. If Ka='-' then KaKs is ~0.0; if Ks='-', then KaKs is undefined; both of these
are shown for the Zero query.

<h3>+Datasets</h3>
Select <tt>Different sets</tt> to only show pairs that are from different dataset,
and <tt>Same sets</tt> to only show pairs from same sets.
<p><tt>Pairs with</tt>: If the mTCW database contains more than two datasets, then the dataset names
will be listed. If one or more datasets are selected, then it will only search for pairs
that contain sequences from the selected dataset(s). 

<h3>+Clusters</h3>
One or more clusters sets will be in the database. They will all be listed here
with an <tt>In</tt> to show pairs that are in the respective cluster, and <tt>Not in</tt>
to only show pairs that are not in the respective cluster.

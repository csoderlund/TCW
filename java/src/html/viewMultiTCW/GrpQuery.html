<title>Filter Clusters</title>
<h2>Filter Clusters</h2>
A cluster must pass ALL filters. The filters selected will be shown at the top
of the resulting filtered Cluster table. Beware:
<ul>
<li>It is easy to forget to unset a filter, so execute "Clear"
to clear all filters in order to start a brand new filter. 
<li>If NO filters are set, all clusters will be displayed -- this can be a big
set and may take wait time to display.
</ul>
<h3>+Basic</h3>
<ul>
<li>Filter on <tt>ClusterID</tt>, <tt>Majority HitID</tt> or <tt>Majority Description</tt>.  
<ul>
<li>The substring will only be searched if the box is checked.
<li>The search is not case-sensitive and will find the substring anywhere in the ID or description.
<li>The second two options have a <tt>Has</tt> and <tt>Not</tt> choice beside
them; if <tt>Not</tt> is selected, show all clusters that do NOT have the substring. For example,
if the substring "uncharacterized" is entered for <tt>Description</tt> along with the <tt>Not</tt>,
only clusters without the substring "uncharacterized" in the description will be shown.
</ul>
<li>See the <a href=http://www.agcol.arizona.edu/software/tcw/doc/mtcw/UserGuide.html#best>online documentation</a>
for details on how the <tt>Majority Hit</tt> is computed.
<br>A <tt>Majority HitID</tt> of "*Novel" indicates none of the sequences in the cluster has
annotation.
<br><br>
<li>The <tt>%Hit</tt> is the percent with the majority description substring, and filters on the <tt>%Hit</tt> column.
</ul>


<h3>+Dataset</h3>
The multiTCW database was created from one or more singleTCW databases, where each
one is referred to as a dataset. Hence, each cluster contains sequences from one
or more dataset.
<ul>
<li>
Select the datasets to <tt>Include</tt>, 
along with setting the minimum number sequences from each selected dataset. 
If desired, select the datasets to <tt>Exclude</tt>, 
along with setting the maximum number of sequences from each selected dataset.

<li>
For both the include and exclude filters, you can choose to apply the sequence limit to 
 <tt>All Datasets</tt> selected, or to <tt>Any Dataset</tt> selected; in the latter case 
the cluster will be shown if it passes the filter for at least one of the selected dataset.
</ul>
<p><i>Example: </i> Include dataset X and dataset Y, exclude all other dataset, 
and select Taxa type 2x1. The results will show only clusters 
with two sequences, one from X and one from Y.

<h3>+Cluster Sets</h3>
<ul>
<li>Filter on <tt>Taxa</tt> column, which is an
indicator of the composition of the cluster, where Mx1 means it contains
M different datasets with exactly one member from each, while MxN means
there are M different datasets, and one or more datasets has more than one
sequence. 
<li>Filter on method, which is the name of the clustering method (more than one
group of clusters can exist in the database, where each cluster set was built with
a given 'Method'). The method is not a column, but the <tt>Overview</tt> has a table of cluster
prefixes with their method.
</ul>

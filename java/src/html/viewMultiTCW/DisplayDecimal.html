<h1>Decimal Numbers Display</h1>
All options immediately change the decimal numbers in the main table, the Basic AnnoDB Hits, and
the Basic GO Annotation tables, except for the <b>Cutoffs</b>, which take effect when the <b>Apply Cutoffs</b>
is pressed.
<p>All parameters are saved between sessions.

<p>Decimal numbers (non-integer) are displayed using the following parameters:
<ol>
<li><b>E-notation</b>:  The number of leading digits for E-notation; e.g. 1.2E-2 
has 2 and 1E-2 has 1 leading digits. Minimum: 1, Default: 2.
<br>&nbsp;
<li><b>Significant digits (figures)</b>:  This is used for numbers &lt;1 that are not E-notation.
This is the number of important digits (see Wikipedia for a good description),
e.g. 0.012 has 2 significant digits. Minimum: 1, Default: 2.
<br>&nbsp;
<li><b>Decimal places</b>: This is used for numbers &gt;1 that are not E-notation. It is
the number of digits after the decimal point, e.g.
123.45 has two decimal places. Minimum: 1, Default: 2.
</ol>

<ol>
<li><b>E-notation</b>: This allows the user to set how big or small 
the <i>absolute value</i> of the 
number can be before switching to E-notation. 
Note, E-notation is scientific notation where 'E' is used to represent the exponent.
To view all numbers without using E-notation, enter 1E+20 and 0 in the two boxes, respectively.
To view all numbers in E-notation, enter 1 in both boxes.
<br>Defaults: 999999.9 and 0.01
<br>&nbsp;
<li><b>Java defaults</b>: Java determines when to switch to E-notation.
</ol>


<h3>Round-off</h3>
This is easiest to explain with an example: 
<p>Example 1: Say you filter on KaKs&lt;0.05.
<br>Given the default value of 2 for <b>Significant digits</b>, all cells of the resulting table should have
values &lt;0.05. However, you will see values of 0.050 due to round-off:
<ol>
<li>If you look in the MySQL database, you will see that an 0.05 may actually have a value like 0.0499590. 
<li>The filter is on the full value, which correctly determines that 0.0499590 &lt; 0.05.
<li>When it is rounded for display, it becomes 0.050. Even at 3 significant digits, it is 0.0500 due to rounding; it
requires 4 significant digits to view 0.04996.
</ol>

<p>Example 2: Say you filter on KaKs&gt;1.0.
<br>Given the default values of 2 for <b>Decimal places</b>, all cells of the resulting table should have
values &gt;1.0. However, you will see values of 1.00 due to round-off:
<ol>
<li>If you look in the MySQL database, you may see that the 1.0 may actually have a value like 1.003.
<li>The filter is on the full value, which correctly determines that 1.003 &gt; 1.00.
<li>When it is rounded for display, showing 2 decimal places becomes 1.00. At  3 decimal places, you will see 1.003.
</ol>

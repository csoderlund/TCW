<h2>Filter Hits</h2>
This filter pertains to the annotation hits that are associated with each sequence.

<p>
A hit must pass ALL filters. The filters selected will be shown at the top
of the resulting filtered Hit table. Beware:
<ul>
<li>It is easy to forget to unset a filter, so execute "Clear"
to clear all filters in order to start a brand new filter. 
<li>If NO filters are set, all hits will be displayed -- this can be a big
set and may take awhile to display.
</ul>

<h3>+Basic</h3>
Click the check box and enter the search value.
<table border=1 cellpadding=3>

<tr><td><tt>Descript</tt><td>This corresponds to the Descript column in the table.
<tr><td><tt>nSeq</tt><td>This corresponds the nSeq column, which is the number of
sequences with the hit.
<tr><td><tt>nBest</tt><td>This corresponds the nBest column, which is the number of
sequences with this as the best hit.

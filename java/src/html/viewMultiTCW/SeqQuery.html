<title>Sequence Filter Help</title>
<h2>Filter Sequences</h2>
A sequence must pass ALL filters. The filters selected will be shown at the top
of the resulting filtered Sequence table. Beware:
<ul>
<li>It is easy to forget to unset a filter, so execute "Clear"
to clear all filters in order to start a brand new filter. 
<li>If NO filters are set, all sequences will be displayed -- this can be a big
set and may take wait time to display.
</ul>

<h3>+Basic</h3>
<table border=1>
<tr><td>SeqID<td>This is useful to find all sequences with a given prefix, or can
be used to find a given sequence. 
<tr><td>Best Hit ID<td>Find all sequences with the given <tt>HitID</tt>, which is its
best annotation hit.
<tr><td>Best Descript<td>Find all sequences with the given <tt>Descript</tt>, which is its
best annotation hit description.  
<tr><td>Hits to different dataset<td>This lists the sequences that have 
a hit to a different dataset. Note: the "Best Hit" refers to the annotation hit, whereas
this refers to the sequence pair hits.
<tr><td>Has Annotation<td>Has at least one annotation hit.
<tr><td>Has GO<td>Has at least one GO assignment.
</table>
<p>Substring queries (<tt>Seq ID</tt>, <tt>Best Hit ID</tt>, <tt>Best Descript</tt>):
The search is not case-sensitive and will find the substring anywhere in the ID or description.

<h3>+Cluster Sets</h3>
The names of all computed cluster sets will be listed. 
If you select <tt>In</tt> for one of the them,
all sequences that are in a corresponding cluster of that method type will be listed.
If you select <tt>Not in</tt>, then all sequences that are not in a cluster of that
method type is listed. You can select multiple <tt>In</tt>, or <tt>Not in</tt>, or a combination.
<br><br>For example: if you have cluster types OM1 (created with inflation 1.5) and
OM5 (created with inflation 5), then selecting <tt>In</tt> OM1 and <tt>Not in</tt> OM5, this will list
all sequences that are in OM1 but not in OM5 clusters.
<h3>TPM</h3>
If the input datasets had read counts, then their normalized values will be in the database.
All conditions will be listed.

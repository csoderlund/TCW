<title>Sequence Filter Help</title>
<h2>Filter Sequences</h2>
A sequence must pass ALL filters. The filters selected will be shown at the top
of the resulting filtered Sequence table. Beware:
<ul>
<li>It is easy to forget to unset a filter, so execute "Clear"
to clear all filters in order to start a brand new filter. 
<li>If NO filters are set, all sequences will be displayed -- this can be a big
set and may take wait time to display.
</ul>

<h3>+Basic</h3>
<table border=1>
<tr><td>SeqID<td>This is useful to find all sequences with a given prefix, or can
be used to find a given sequence. 
<tr><td>Hits to different dataset<td>This lists the sequences that have 
a hit to a different dataset. 
<tr><td>Has Annotation<td>Has at least one hitID.
<tr><td>Has GO<td>Has at least one GO assignment.
</table>
<h3>+Cluster Sets</h3>
The names of all computed cluster sets will be listed. 
If you select "In" for one of the them,
all sequences that are in a corresponding cluster of that method type will be listed.
If you select "Not in", then all sequences that are not in a cluster of that
method type is listed. You can select multiple "In", or "Not in" or a combination.
<br><br>For example: if you have cluster types OM1 (created with inflation 1.5) and
OM5 (created with inflation 5), then selecting "In" OM1 and "Not in" OM5, this will list
all sequences that are in OM1 but not in OM5 clusters.
<h3>+RPKM/FPKM</h3>
If the input datasets had read counts, then their normalized values will be in the database.
All conditions will be listed.

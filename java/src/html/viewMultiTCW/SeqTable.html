<title>Sequence Table</title>
<h2>Sequence Table</h2>

This table can be viewed from (1) Sample List "Sequences", (2) Filter "Sequence", or 
(3) selecting a row in the cluster, pairs or hit table.

<h3>Row of functions at the top</h3>

<u>Details</u> For the selected sequence: show counts, TPM values, 
and annotations. 

<p><u>Clusters</u> For the selected sequence(s): 
Show the table of clusters containing the sequence.

<p><u>Pairs</u> For the selected sequence(s): 
Show the table of pairs containing at least one of the selected sequences.

<p><u>Copy...</u> For the selected sequence: 
Copies the seqID, AA, NT or CDS sequence, Best hitID, Best description or Best hit sequence.

<p><u>Table...</u>
<ul>
<li><b>Show Column Stats</b>: Popup a table of statistics for the numeric columns in the table. 
<br>&nbsp;

<li><b>Copy Table</b>: Copies the table to the clipboard either the entire table. 
<br>&nbsp;

<li><b>Export Table</b>: Exports the table to file in tab delimited file. 
<br>&nbsp;

<li><b>Export AA sequences</b>: Export the translated CDS sequences..
<br>&nbsp;

<li><b>Export CDS sequences</b>: Export the CDS sequences.
<br>&nbsp;

<li><b>Export NT sequences</b>: Export the full nucleotide sequences.
<br>&nbsp;

<li><b>Export all GOs</b> (If GOs are in the database): Output all assigned and inherited GOs for all seq-hit pairs 
for all sequences in the table. 
The first three are filters::
<ol>
<li><i>GO Level</i>: 
<ol type='a'>
<li>Level 1 is the three ontologies (top level). Level 2 are the GO terms directly beneath
the top level, etc (see GO annotations 'GO Help' for more explanation). 
<li>If you leave this blank, it will output all GOs. 
<li>If you just want a couple of levels, e.g. 2 and 3, first export level 2, then export level 3
to the same file and use the append option (there will be a pop-up asking whether you want to append).
</ol>

<li><i>Any Ontology</i>: This toggles through the three main ontology. If you select one, it will only 
export the GOs in that ontology.

<li><i>E-value</i>: If you leave this blank, it will ignore the E-value. Otherwise,
the sequence must have at least one seq-hit with E-value&le; this value.

<li><i>File Columns</i>:
<ol type='a'>
<li>Verbose: outputs columns (GO is the column for the ontology abbreviation)
<tt>
GO-ID	#Seqs	Level	GO	GO-Name
</tt>
<li>Count only: only outputs the <tt>GO-ID</tt> and <tt>#Seqs</tt>. 
<br>This can be used as input to input to REVIGO (http://revigo.irb.hr)
</ol>
</ul>
</ul>

<h2>Columns</h2>
<ul> 
<li>Columns can be added/removed using the <b>Select Columns</b> button below the table. 
<li>Columns can
also be rearranged (by dragging the headers) and sorted (by clicking the headers). 
<li>Put the mouse over a column heading in the <b>Select Columns</b> interface, and a full explanation of the column is shown
in the lower left corner.
</ul>

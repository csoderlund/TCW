<title>Sequence Table</title>
<h2>Sequence Table</h2>

This table can be viewed from (1) Sample List "Sequences", (2) Filter "Sequence", or 
(3) selecting a row in the cluster, pairs or hit table.

<h3>First row of functions at the top</h3>
The bottom panel can be switch between <b>Table</b> and the results of any of the "Align:" buttons.

<p><b>Aligned (selected):</b> If none are selected, the default selection is all rows.
<ul>
<li><u>Pairwise...</u>
<table border=1 cellpadding=3>
<tr><td><b>AA for each pair</b> <td><td>Perform pairwise 
alignment for all pairs of amino acid sequences from the selected sequences. 
<tr><td><b>NT for each pair</b><td nowrap>NT-mTCW only<td> Perform pairwise 
alignment for all pairs of nucleotide sequences from the selected sequences (. 
<tr><td><b>AA,NT,CDS for one pair</b> <td>NT-mTCW only; 2 seqs 
<td>Align the selected pair using the amino acid sequence,
CDS sequence, and nucleotide sequences. The resulting panel will have these 3 alignments.
<tr><td><b>5UTR, CDS, 3UTR for one pair</b> <td>NT-mTCW only; 2 seqs
<td>Align these three regions separately for the pair.
The resulting panel will have these 3 alignments.
<tr><td><b>AA to sequence best hit</b><td>
<td>The best hit for each sequence will be aligned to it.
<tr><td><b>AA to cluster best hit</b> <td>For Cluster only
<td>The assigned cluster best hit is aligned to each sequence in the cluster.
</table>

<br>The Pairwise options can result in many alignments,  e.g. if 20 sequences are selected,
190 alignments will be computed;  watch progress in lower left corner of viewMultiTCW.
<br>&nbsp;

<li><u>MSAdb</u> (Cluster set of sequences only) 
The MAFFT-AA alignment has been stored in the database, so can be displayed
without running the program. However, this option does not produce the alignment 
or score files, where the MSA... option does.
<br>&nbsp;

<li><u>MSA...</u> 
<ul>
<li><b>MUSCLE-AA</b>: 
Run MUSCLE to build a multiple alignment 
for all amino acid sequences in the table or for the selected set. This can be very time consuming
when run on many sequences. The command executed is:
<pre>
/Ext/linux/muscle/muscle -in ResultAlign/inSeq.fa -out ResultAlign/outAln.fa
</pre>
You can view the results along with the scores in the <tt>ResultAlign</tt> directory.
The first score is the average of the column sums from the sum-of-pairs. The
second is the trident method, run as follows (use -g to output global score only):
<pre>
/Ext/linux/mstatX/mstatx -s trident -i ResultAlign/outAln.fa -o ResultAlign/score2.txt
</pre>
<li><b>MAFFT-AA</b>: Same as above.
The command executed is:
<pre>
/Ext/linux/mafft/mafft.bat --auto --reorder --thread N ResultAlign/inSeq.fa
</pre>
Where N is the number of available threads (processors/CPUs).
<br><br>
<li><b>MAFFT-CDS</b>: (NT-mTCW only) Same as above but with the CDS sequences
<br><br>
<li><b>MAFFT-NT</b>: (NT-mTCW only) Same as above but with the NT sequences

</ul>
<p><i>On Mac, replace <tt>Ext/linux</tt> with <tt>Ext/mac</tt></i>.
</ul>

<ul>
<li><u>Table...</u>
<ul>
<li><b>Show Column Stats</b>: Popup a table of statistics for the numeric columns in the table. Note: if you Export the table and 
compute the statistics, their results will not be as precise.
<br>&nbsp;

<li><b>Copy Table</b>: Copies the table to the clipboard either the entire table. 
<br>&nbsp;

<li><b>Export Table</b>: Exports the table to file in tab delimited file. 
<br>&nbsp;

<li><b>Export AA sequences</b>:Export the translated CDS sequences..
<br>&nbsp;

<li><b>Export CDS sequences</b>:Export the CDS sequences.
<br>&nbsp;

<li><b>Export NT sequences</b>:Export the full nucleotide sequences.
<br>&nbsp;


<li><b>Export all GOs:</b> output all assigned and inherited GOs for all seq-hit pairs 
for all sequences in the table. 
The first three are filters::
<ol>
<li><i>GO Level</i>: 
<ol type='a'>
<li>Level 1 is the three domains. Level 2 are the GO terms directly beneath
a domain, etc (see GO annotations 'GO Help' for more explanation). 
<li>If you leave this blank, it will output all GOs. 
<li>If you just want a couple of levels, e.g. 2 and 3, first export level 2, then export level 3
to the same file and use the append option (there will be a pop-up asking whether you want to append).
</ol>

<li><i>Any domain</i>: This toggles through the three main domains. If you select one, it will only 
export the GOs in that domain.

<li><i>E-value</i>: If you leave this blank, it will ignore the E-value. Otherwise,
the sequence must have at least one seq-hit with E-value&le; this value.

<li><i>File Columns</i>:
<ol type='a'>
<li>Verbose: outputs columns 
<tt>
GOterm	#Seqs	Level	Term_type	Description
</tt>
<li>Count only: only outputs the <tt>GOterm</tt> and <tt>#Seqs</tt>. 
<br>This can be used as input to input to REVIGO (http://revigo.irb.hr)
</ol>
</ul>
</ul>

<h3>Second row of functions at the top</h3>
<ul>
<li><u>Details</u> For the selected sequence: show counts, TPM values, 
and annotations. 
<br>&nbsp;
<li><u>Pairs</u> For the selected sequence(s): 
Show the table of pairs containing at least one of the selected sequences.
<br>&nbsp;
<li><u>Clusters</u> For the selected sequence: 
Show the table of clusters containing the sequence.
<br>&nbsp;
<li><u>Copy...</u> For the selected sequence: 
Copies the seqID, AA, NT or CDS sequence, Best hitID, Best description or Best hit sequence.
<br>&nbsp;
<li><u>Clear</u> Clears the selected sequences.

</ul>



<h2>Columns</h2>
<ul> 
<li>Columns can be added/removed using the <b>Select Columns</b> button below the table. 
<li>Columns can
also be rearranged (by dragging the headers) and sorted (by clicking the headers). 
<li>Put the mouse over a column heading in the <b>Select Columns</b> interface, and a full explanation of the column is shown
in the lower left corner.
</ul>

<h1>Differential expression (DE)</h1>

This tool allows you to define groups of conditions and compute their 
differential expression, either using R package <tt>edgeR</tt> or <tt>DESeq2</tt>, or supplying
an R-script for a given R package that computes DE. 
 
DE-enriched GO categories can also be found using <tt>GOSeq</tt> or a user-supplied R-script.
See the Online Guide for assistance installing the R packages.

<h2>Compute p-values for DE</h2>
The following gives the basic facts. Details can be found in the last section.
<ol>
<li><u>R-script</u>: Select a file that contains R commands.
Two methods are provided as example, <tt>edgeRglm.R</tt> and <tt>DESeq2.R</tt>.

<li>Pre-filter:
<ul>
<li><u>Count</u>: Any sequence that does not have at least one sample with counts >cutoff is not evaluated. 
<li><u>CPM</u>: This has two parameters, say N and M.
Any sequence that does not have CPM &gt; N for &gt;= M samples is not evaluated.
The CPM for a sequence is the (count/sample_size) * 1E6. For example, if there are 2 conditions
with 3 replicates each, and N=20 and M=2, then at least 2 of the 6 samples
must have CPM&gt;20. 

<li><u>None</u>: No filtering.
</ul>
<p>If you want to see the first 25 (non-zero) filtered sequences, then use:
<pre>
		runDE [database_name] -v
</pre>
The values will be written to the terminal near the top of the output.

<p>When viewing the results in <tt>viewSingleTCW</tt>,
the filtered sequences will have a 3 for the DE value. If the DE analysis return a
NA, it will have a value of 2.
<p>
<li><u>Fixed dispersion</u>: used when there are no replicates. 
<ul>
<li>For <tt>edgeR</tt>, if there are no replicates and this is not set, it will use a 0.1 dispersion. 
<li><tt>DESeq2</tt> does not use a  fixed dispersion (see its documentation). 
<li>This value will be written to the R environment using the variable 'disp'.
</ul>

</ol>
Execute
<ol>
<li><b>All Pairs for Group 1</b>: 
<ul>
<li>Only check conditions in Group 1.
<li>Results will be saved in the database with auto-generated column names.
<li>Each pair of conditions selected in group 1 will compared; any selections
in Group 2 are ignored.
</ul>
<li><b>Group 1 - Group 2</b>: 
<ul>
<li>Select at least one condition from each group. 
The condition(s) in Group 1 will be compared with the condition(s) in group 2.
<li>If you want to store the results in the database:
<ul>
<li>Check <u>Save results in P-value column</u>.
If the groups have been selected, a column name will be auto-generated which you can change.
<li>When you change the groups for a subsequent execution, uncheck-then-check the column box
to auto-generated a name for the new groups. 
</ul>
<li>This is the only option that allows you to compute DE without writing to the database,
e.g. if you want to view the results in R first.
<li>This is the only option that checks to see if you are over-writing an existing column.
</ul>

<li><b>All Pairs from File</b>: 
<ul>
<li>The Condition section is ignored; the conditions to
compare are specified in the file (see file format in "Details").
<li>Results will be saved in the database with the provided column names.
<li>All pairs from the file will be compared with the selected method
and options.
</ul>
<li><b>P-values from file</b>
<ul>
<li>The Conditions and options are ignored, and R is not used.
<li>The p-values are read from file (see "Details" below for file format). 
</ul>
</ol>
<p><i>A p-value does not distinguish whether condition 1 is greater than condition 2 or vice versa.
Therefore, if the count for condition 1 is less than the count for condition 2, 
a negative sign is put before the p-value.</i>

<p>The first three options will leave your terminal in the "R environment", described
in the section below.

<h2>GO enrichment</h2>
Select <b>Execute</b> to run the specified <u>R-script</u> on the selected column(s). The
default R-script computes <tt>GOseq</tt>.
The data will be entered into the GO table of the database using the p-value column name.
If the GO p-value column exists, it will overwrite the existing value.
<p><u>Cutoff</u>:
<ol>
<li>P-value: If a sequence has a DE p-value less than this amount (e.g. 0.05), 
it is considered DE. <tt>GOseq</tt>
takes as input the information as to whether or not each sequence is DE, 
where a 1 indicates it is and a 0 indicates it is not. 
<i>According to the <tt>goSeq</tt> documentation, the results are 
NOT multiple hypothesis tested.</i>
<li>Top X%: Instead of a p-value, you can request that the X% of the sequences with the
lowest DE be considered DE for input to <tt>GOseq</tt>.
</ol> 
NOTE: It does not check if the GO p-value column exists, it will automatically replace it.
<!----------------------------------------------------!>
<h2>Remove p-value columns</h2>

Select <b>Remove</b> to remove the selected p-value column(s) and corresponding GO column (if it exists).
A value of <u>All p-values</u> will remove all p-value columns.

<!----------------------------------------------------!>
<h2>Update, Close and Exit</h2>
<ol>
<li><b>Update Overview</b>:
The "Overview" needs to be updated after changes to the DE columns.
It will also display the overview; if there have been no changes, it will only display.
<li><b>Close</b>: Close the window, but do not exit the R environment (if active).
<li><b>Exit</b>: Close the window, and if there are no other active <tt>runDE</tt>
windows, exit R.
</ol>
<!----------------------------------------------------!>
<h3>R environment</h3>
At the end of execution, the terminal will be in the "R environment" so that you can execute
R commands to view graphs of the results. You can tell when it is in the R environment because there is only a ">" for the prompt.

<p>To exit the R environment,  enter <tt>q()</tt>; it will ask
you if you want to 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<tt>Save workspace image? [y/n/c]</tt>:
<ul>
<li> y - exit and saves the environment; you can later restart R
<li> n - exit and and do not save the environment
<li> c - do not exit -- continue
</ul>
<p>
However, when <tt>runDE</tt> writes to the terminal, you will no longer see the ">"; hit
carriage return and you will get the "<tt>Save workspace image?</tt>" prompt. 
<p>
Some R commands of interest:
<ul>
<li>Type <tt>ls()</tt> to list the defined variables. 
<li>Type a variable name to view its
contents. 
<li>The build-in methods print ways to display a plot, e.g. for
<tt>edgeR</tt>,  it says "<tt>Scatter plot: plotBCV(y)</tt>".
</ul>
When querying the R environment from <tt>runDE</tt>, the scroll keys may not work.
In order to use the scroll keys,
type q(), followed by 'y', then start the R environment from the command line.

<h2>Details</h2>
<h3>Select conditions</h3>

<p>
Ordinarily you should pick exactly one condition for each group, creating a two-condition comparison.
In this case, any replicates in the conditions will automatically be used by the methods
which employ replicates.
<p>
You can also form groups having more than one condition, in which case the conditions in a given
group will be treated as replicates. This is not recommended unless the conditions are
expected to be quite similar; instead, you can run the desired pairwise comparisons, and then
use the filtering functions in <tt>viewSingleTCW</tt> to construct filters involving DE among
multiple conditions.
<p>
If you will be comparing multiple single TCW databases using the multi-TCW programs, make
sure that the condition names and DE column names are the same.

<h3>Get Pairs from File</h3>
The file can have many rows, where each line contains three columns separated by blanks.
The first column is group1, the second is group2, and the third is the 
p-value column name. If
you want multiple conditions for group1, separate them with colons. For example:
<pre>
root stem RoSt
root rhiz RoRz
root:rhiz stem RRxStS
</pre>
This will run the selected method on these three sets and create columns RoST, RoRz, RRxST.
The third entry uses two conditions for the first group.
<p>It will overwrite any existing p-value columns with the same name.
<p>Blank lines and lines starting with '#' are ignored.

<h3>P-values from File</h3>
The first line defines the two groups and the p-value column name, using the same format
as the "Get Pairs from File". All remaining lines have
a <tt>seqID</tt> followed by the p-value. For example,
<pre>
#Example p-value file 
root stem RoSt
tra_001	0.14
tra_002	0.14
tra_003	0.65
</pre>
The p-values are read as absolute values since <tt>runDE</tt> makes values negative if
Cond1&lt;Cond2.
<h3>R-scripts</h3>
For each pair (from any of the Execute approaches):
<ol>
<li>R is started, and the following values are written to the R environment:
<ul>
<li><i>countData</i>: count values are written to a matrix where the row names are the
sequence names.
<li><i>grpNames</i>: an array of the column names by group. For example, if Root and Rhiz
are selected as Group 1 and Group 2, the values in this array will be:
<tt>
root, root, root, rhiz, rhiz, rhiz
</tt>
<li>Other variables are also written. To view them, execute an existing script;
the variables are written to standard out with explanations.
</ul>
<li>The R-script is execute with the "source" command.
<li>The results should be in an array called <i>results</i>, which is read by TCW.  Also,
<i>rowNames</i> is read and should be in the same order as the <i>results</i>; this array
is created before the R-script execution, so if the order is not changes, it does not
need to be changed.
</ol>
See the existing scripts for example. The <u>GO enrichment</u> also uses an R-script in 
a similar way (see <tt>goSeq.R</tt>).

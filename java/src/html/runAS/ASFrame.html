<h1>Annotation Setup</h1>
<code>RunAS</code> downloads the UniProt databases, creates FASTA files and creates a GO database.
The UniProt FASTA files and GO database will be used in <code>runSingleTCW</code> to 
annotate the sequences. 

<p>It is <i><b>very important</i></b> to read the online
<a href=http://www.agcol.arizona.edu/software/tcw/doc/stcw/AnnoDBs.html>AnnoDB documentation</a>.
It provides details along with time and memory considerations.

<p>Other databases (e.g. NCBI nr) can also be used in <code>runSingleTCW</code> for annotation, 
but will not have GO support, and need to be downloaded manually 
(see the online <a href=http://www.agcol.arizona.edu/software/tcw/doc/stcw/AnnoDBs.html#other>Other AnnoDBs</a>.).

<h2>Requirements</h2>
<ul>
<li><code>runAS</code> uses <code>curl</code> for downloading annoDBs and the GO database; it 
will work without <code>curl</code>, but is not as reliable.
<li>See the online <a href=http://www.agcol.arizona.edu/software/tcw/doc/stcw/AnnoDBs.html#over>Requirements</a>
for more information.
</ul>

<h2>Demo</h2>
From the command line, run "<tt>./runAS -d</tt>" and the correct values for the demo will be entered. It is only necessary
to run <b>Build GO</b>, as the rest of the necessary files are in the TCW package, i.e. 
under <tt>DBfasta/UniProt_demo</tt>.

<h2>Processing steps</h2>
All files are created in the "UniProt" directory, default <tt>projects/DBfasta/UniProt_&lt;date&gt;</tt>.
<ol>
<li>Select the taxonomic databases you want to use, followed by <b>Build Tax</b>.
<br>This will download each selected UniProt .dat file(s) and create .fasta files from them.
<br>&nbsp;
<li>Select the "SwissProt" under "Full UniProt", followed by <b>Build Full</b>.
<br>This will download the full SwissProt .dat file, create a new .dat file without 
the taxonomic entries from the downloaded files,
and then create the .fasta file from the new .dat file.
<br>&nbsp;
<li>Create the GO database with <b>Build GO</b>.
<br>This will download the GO database, creates a local mySQL GO database with a mapping of the UniProts from your downloaded set. 
This uses the information in HOSTS.cfg. 
</ol>

<h2>Suggestions</h2>
<ul>
<li>Download all relevant SwissProt files and the Full SwissProt UniProt. 
<li>Download only the most relevant TrEMBL files. Do not download the Full TrEMBL UniProt unless absolutely necessary.
<li>See the online <a href=http://www.agcol.arizona.edu/software/tcw/doc/stcw/AnnoDBs.html#mem>Memory and time</a>
and <a href=http://www.agcol.arizona.edu/software/tcw/doc/stcw/AnnoDBs.html#best>What AnnoDBs to use</a>.
</ul>

<h2>Check</h2> 
If a label is highlighted in blue, the directory exists.
<br>If a checkbox is highlighted in pink, the .dat file is downloaded but the .fasta file does not exist.
<br>If a checkbox is highlighted in blue, both the .dat file and .fasta file exists.
<p>Select <b>Check</b> to update the highlighting.
Check is automatically run on startup, and when any of the three "Builds" are executed.

<p><b><i>Downloads are never re-downloaded</b></i>: 
If you re-run a "Build" when the corresponding labels are highlighted, new files will
not be downloaded but the the appropriate files (e.g. .fasta) will be recreated. If you want to download new files,
you must manually remove the corresponding directory.


<h2>AnnoDB.cfg</h2>
Creates a file called <tt>projects/Anno_UniProt_&lt;date&gt;.cfg</tt> that can be used to load the information
into <code>runSingleTCW</code> using the "Import AnnoDBs" option. This saves you from having
to input each UniProt database.

<h2>Clean up</h2>
<tt>runAS</tt> does not remove files that are no longer necessary, which are
the files downloaded from the internet. The following files can be removed after
ALL processing is complete:
<ul>
<li>All "dat.gz" files in the UniProt directories, as the information has
been transferred to the FASTA files and GO database, which is what <tt>runSingleTCW</tt>
uses.
<li>The GO directory, as the information has been transferred to the GO database. 
</ul>
However, if you do not have a space problem, keep them just for insurance. 
When UniProt does the monthly update, your downloaded files will no longer available
on their site. 

<p>If you are going to use <code>DIAMOND</code> for the searches, you may gzip the .fasta
files.

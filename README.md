**Description:** For single-species (singleTCW) - similarity search against annotation databases, GO annotation, 
ORF finding and differential analysis. For multi-species (multiTCW) - compute similar pairs, provide statistics for pairs, compute clusters, provide statistics for clusters. 
Both singleTCW and multiTCW provide graphical interfaces for extensive query and display of the results.

**Download TCW tarball:** https://github.com/csoderlund/TCW/releases.
The TCW tarball contains the executable jar files, external packages and demo files.

**Documentation:**  https://csoderlund.github.io/TCW

**Requirements:** Java and MySQL to build the database and view the results. R for differential analysis.  
All other external software used by TCW is contained in the package tar file. TCW has been tested on Linux and MacOS.
